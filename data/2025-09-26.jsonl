Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all\ntemporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs.

DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional\nclustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post\nhoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals.

In\nthis work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on\noffloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips\nand traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate\nrevisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present\nSuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses\nHopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.\nSuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as\nadaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware\ncasting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace\nCPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x\nthroughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,\nenabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high\ntraining throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data\nparallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of\n13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while\nachieving 55% MFU."}

EvoMail first constructs a unified\nheterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,\nsenders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive\nGraph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs\ncontext-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam\ncampaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution\nloop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character\nobfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector\nlearns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses\nthem for future reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,\nSpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that\nEvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection\naccuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of\nreasoning traces.

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals\nand thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a\ncomputationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information\ndecomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into\nfine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and\nsynergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically\nbalances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial\nstate to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nOur work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a\npowerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking\nsynergistic multi-modal fusion."}

In this paper, we introduce Federated\nFlow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under\nprivacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each\nclient trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving\nprivacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,\nwhich employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within\neach client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we\npropose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of\noptimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates\ncouplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that\nFFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow\nstraightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance\ncomparable to the centralized baseline."}

However,\nexisting privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such\nas Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential\nPrivacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited\nscalability. This survey examines emerging approaches that hold promise for\nenhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing\n(QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm\nIntelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL\npipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations.\nWe conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,\noffering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems."}
