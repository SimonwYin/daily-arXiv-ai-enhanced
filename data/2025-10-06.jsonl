The lack of regulation in artificial intelligence is\nnecessary because it raises the question of how we can move forward without\nknowing what the limits are. While artificial intelligence dominates the\ntechnology industry, new technology is starting to emerge. Quantum cryptography\nis expected to replace classical cryptography; however, the transition from\nclassical to quantum cryptography is expected to occur within the next 10\nyears. The ability to transition from classical to quantum cryptography\nrequires hybrid cryptography.

Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that\nfoils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In\nstark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the\ndiscrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.\nIt maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively\nneutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance\ndemonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than\nmerely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine\nrobustness in the adversarial arms race."}

A key design principle is that\nboth the winning set and the per-QLAN quota are fixed by measurements alone, so\nthe contention loop requires no classical round trip.

This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx,\nimproving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the\ntrustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client\ndevices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate\nheterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive\nperturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits. The model achieves a\ntesting accuracy of 98.32% per-timestep (F1_{attack}=0.972) and 93.35%\nper-sequence at 0.15% FPR using a simple decision rule with run-length m=2 and\nthreshold $\\tau=0.55$. The results demonstrate that combining spatial and\ntemporal context enables reliable detection of stealthy reconnaissance while\nmaintaining low false-positive rates, making the approach suitable for non-IID\nfederated smart-grid deployments."}

We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects.

First, the processors, attacks, and defenses often\nexhibit probabilistic behaviors. These probabilistic behaviors arise due to\nnatural noise in systems (e.g., from co-running processes), probabilistic side\nchannel attacks, and probabilistic obfuscation defenses. Second,\nmicroprocessors are extremely complex. Previous evaluation methods have relied\non abstract or simplified models, which are necessarily less detailed than real\nsystems or cycle-by-cycle simulators, and these models may miss important\nphenomena. Whereas a simple model may suffice for estimating performance,\nsecurity issues frequently manifest in the details.\n  We address this challenge by introducing Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to\nthe quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels. SMC is a\nrigorous statistical technique that can process the results of probabilistic\nexperiments and provide statistical guarantees, and it has been used in\ncomputing applications that depend heavily on statistical guarantees (e.g.,\nmedical implants, vehicular computing). With SMC, we can treat processors as\nopaque boxes, and we do not have to abstract or simplify them. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of SMC through three case studies, in which we experimentally\nshow that SMC can evaluate existing security vulnerabilities and defenses and\nprovide qualitatively similar conclusions with greater statistical rigor, while\nmaking no simplifying assumptions or abstractions. We also show that SMC can\nenable a defender to quantify the amount of noise necessary to have a desired\nlevel of confidence that she has reduced an attacker's probability of success\nto less than a desired threshold, thus providing the defender with an\nactionable plan for obfuscation via noise injection."}

We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens.

Since the\nobjective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two\ndifferentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and\nthe corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate\nthe decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's\nunrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more\nflexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\\% attack success rates\nagainst recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and\nCOLD-Attack by over 20\\%."}

Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a\nbiologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,\nfounded on geometric Brownian motion."}

We propose a novel methodology,\nComponent-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome\ntemporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring\nof millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models\nspanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise\nenergy variance below 9.5\\% while capturing more than 90\\% of the model's total\nenergy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention\nblocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),\nindicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP\ncounts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a\ncomponent level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy\nbaselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient\ntransformer models through component-level optimizations."}

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance.

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on\nresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been\ndeveloped to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders\nfrom healthy controls.

While deep learning models are expected to operate\nwithout manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant\nchallenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support\ndiagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this\nstudy, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework\nnamed BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to\nidentify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during\nmodel training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model\nagainst nine established brain network classification methods across three\nmulti-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior\ndiagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data.

However, this flexibility introduces\nsafety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious\ndemonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful\nexamples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs\nin which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such\nattacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful\ndemonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline\n``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context\ndemonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control\n(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance\nbelow zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,\nignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.\nFinally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk\nfor harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on\nhelpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that\nour approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations\nwhile simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with\nhelpful demonstrations."}

Building on prior work of large\nlanguage models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the\nvision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting\nrepresentations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,\ntermed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's\nperformance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image\ndatasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that\nstrongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function\nvectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further\ndemonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a\nmodest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to\nsignificantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that\nrelation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy\nproblems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the\nstrong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs\nencode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which\ncan be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our\nunderstanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational\nreasoning in LMMs."}

Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K\nsteadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does\nnot hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain\nhard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.\nInterestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different\nsubsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only\npart of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also\nenables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning\n(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide\na comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature\nvoting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our\nfindings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that\ntemperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent\npotential of base models."}

Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to\na narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,\nlacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated\nby ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.\nLeveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety\ndataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk\ncategories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory\nrisks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness\nof VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance\nto improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats."}
