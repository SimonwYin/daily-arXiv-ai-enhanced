In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86AI\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e6\u53d1\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u610f\u56fe\u6d17\u767d\u6280\u672f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u6d17\u767d\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u6389\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u79fb\u9664\u89e6\u53d1\u7ebf\u7d22\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e4b\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\"\u5408\u7406\u5b89\u5168\"\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u610f\u56fe\u6d17\u767d\u6280\u672f\u9002\u5e94\u4e3a\u8d8a\u72f1\u6280\u672f\u540e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e6\u53d1\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8131\u8282\u3002"}}

Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5bf9LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7531100\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u5e26\u7684\u516b\u79cd\u6ce8\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u516b\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u57289,366\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5c0f\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe96.9%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u4e8647%\u7684\u9057\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6ce8\u91ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u672a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e2d\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u53c9\u5f15\u7528\u6700\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5feb\u7167\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0RMWable\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4&\u4ea4\u6362\u6216\u52a0\u8f7d-\u94fe\u63a5/\u5b58\u50a8-\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u5f3a\u5927\u4f4e\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdRMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4f46\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\u53c2\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bfb\u5199\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u8bfb/\u5199\u53ef\u8bfb\u5199\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features.

While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks.

Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. However, practical deployments face challenges when clients have heterogeneous resources and thus adopt different LoRA ranks, leading to substantial initialization and aggregation noise that undermines performance. To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6b21\u7ea7\u78b0\u649e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u8fbe91%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e\u78b0\u649e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6b21\u7ea7\u78b0\u649e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa91%\u7684\u6b21\u7ea7\u78b0\u649e\uff0cROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u4ece\u4e2a\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u76840.654, 0.744, \u548c0.902\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.952\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6b21\u7ea7\u78b0\u649e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6b21\u7ea7\u78b0\u649e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe91%\uff0c\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u4f4e\u81f30.20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5373\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5355\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u540e\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\u5fc5\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u6784\u9020\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u6210\u672c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5bbd\u5168\u5c40\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u6765\u907f\u514d\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u666e\u904d\u8868\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5173\u3002"}}

Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable.

To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity.

Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method.

Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.\n  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.\n  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies.

Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.\n  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average.

Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $\u03a9(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \\& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $\u03a9(\\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs.\n  In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = \u0398(\\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86'Grokking'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u524d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76'Grokking'\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5757\u7b97\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u7b97\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740'Grokking'\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u4ece\u5904\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u9003\u9038\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.\n  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.\n  As a first step, we focus on $\u03a3$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $\u03a3$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $\u03a3$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.\n  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGrothendieck\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5c42\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8$\u03a3$-\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62bd\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u57fa\u7840\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Grothendieck\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5c42\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aGrothendieck\u7ad9\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790$\u03a3$-\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e$\u03a3$-\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e0e\u5c42\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2atorsor\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u51e1\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u622a\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5065\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e86Schnorr $\u03a3$-\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u62bd\u8c61\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.\n  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired.

To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility.

Whether the Fischlin transform is straight-line extractable against quantum adversaries has remained open due to the difficulty of reasoning about the likelihood of query transcripts in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM), even when using the compressed oracle methodology. In this work, we prove that the Fischlin transform remains straight-line extractable in the QROM, via an extractor based on the compressed oracle. This establishes the post-quantum security of the Fischlin transform, providing a post-quantum straight-line extractable NIZK alternative to Pass' transform with smaller proof size.

Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity.

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ece\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7269\u7406\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u5177\u8eabAI\u6545\u969c\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u8eabAI\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8981\u4fdd\u969c\u5177\u8eab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u5173\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets.

In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the G\u00e4rdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements.

We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer.

This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations.

Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u7701\u7565\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u7701\u7565\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments.

In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally.

Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs.

Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior.

In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods.

Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines.

We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GAP\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516d\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u81f3\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u62d2\u7edd\u8bf7\u6c42\u4f46\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4f9d\u7136\u6267\u884c\u7981\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality.

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand.

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%.

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5021\u5bfc\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5021\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6765\u6df1\u8fdc\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u6784\u5728\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint.

To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories.

Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Cinder\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u521d\u7b5b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u73a9\u5bb6\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u961f\u4f0d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "Cinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u5feb\u901f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u6280\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u961f\u4f0d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u6876\u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u6392\u540d\u8fdb\u884c\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790140\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u7684Sanction Score\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u624e\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u8fc5\u901f\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728140\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline).

In a 200-question run on a customized enterprise schema on October 19, 2025, the Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 by 13 points and ChatGPT-5 by 24.1 points on the 100-point composite score, giving customers a repeatable way to compare AI solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales\u4e2d\u7684Sales Research Agent\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6CRM\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684CRM\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u56de\u7b54\u9500\u552e\u4e3b\u7ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u65f6CRM\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u5907\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Sales Research Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u5ba2\u6237\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f01\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684200\u95ee\u9898\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSales Research Agent\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u8d85\u8fc7Claude Sonnet 4.5 13\u5206\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7ChatGPT-5 24.1\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6bd4\u8f83AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9009\u62e9\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ed6\u4eec\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions.

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima.

Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps.

While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u65e0\u635f\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6811\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97OT\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u904d\u5386\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad85%\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u635f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6811\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u635f\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6811\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u904d\u5386\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08Traversal Verification\uff09\u59cb\u7ec8\u5904\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u900a\u8272\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8349\u7a3f\u6811\u6839\u90e8\u9644\u8fd1\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8349\u7a3f\u6811\u8f83\u6df1\u5904\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u589e\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u8349\u7a3f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u51fa\u73b0\u504f\u79bb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6811\u6269\u5c55\uff08delayed tree expansion\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6293\u8349\u7a3f\u8def\u5f84\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u652f\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8349\u7a3f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u57fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u671f\u533a\u5757\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97OT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SpecInfer\u9996\u6b21\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u904d\u5386\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad85%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6811\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3a\u4f18\u79c0\u3002"}}

However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies.

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability.

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "WS-GRPO enhances GRPO's efficiency by providing guidance on when to stop or continue reasoning, resulting in shorter rollouts without sacrificing accuracy.", "motivation": "To address the inefficiencies in reasoning and the difficulties in calibrating length penalties in GRPO, providing better control over reasoning behavior.", "method": "WS-GRPO uses terminal rewards to create correctness-aware guidance for partial trajectories, training a preference model that signals when to continue or stop reasoning.", "result": "Empirical results indicate that WS-GRPO reduces rollout length substantially compared to GRPO, achieving competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks.", "conclusion": "WS-GRPO significantly improves rollout efficiency while maintaining accuracy, outperforming GRPO baselines on reasoning tasks."}}

This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models.

Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation.

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "FATE is an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that improves early warning capabilities in time-series data by using ensemble forecasting models and achieves significant performance gains without needing anomaly labels.", "motivation": "There is a critical need for proactive anomaly detection in time-series data across various domains, as traditional methods only react to anomalies post-occurrence.", "method": "FATE uses an unsupervised framework that quantifies predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of forecasting models to detect Precursors-of-Anomaly.", "result": "FATE improves the PTaPR AUC by 19.9 percentage points and the early detection F1 score by 20.02 percentage points compared to baseline methods, validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.", "conclusion": "FATE demonstrates superior performance in detecting anomalies proactively in time-series data, significantly improving early warning capabilities with no need for anomaly labels."}}

We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail.

This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions.

While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAMO\u548cNAMO-D\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u4ea4\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982Adam\u548cMuon\u5728\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAMO\u548cNAMO-D\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9002\u5e94\uff0cNAMO\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957f\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u4ea4\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u800cNAMO-D\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u53f3\u4e58\u6b63\u4ea4\u52a8\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aNAMO\u548cNAMO-D\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eAdamW\u548cMuon\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMO\u548cNAMO-D\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\u548cMuon\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fNAMO-D\u901a\u8fc7\u9644\u52a0\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9002\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts.

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u52a0\u5feb\u968f\u673a\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62bd\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210AI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4Kolmogorov\u6d41\u7684\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u62bd\u6837\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u5feb\u62bd\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLoRG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFLoRG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u5176Gram\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u805a\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "FLoRG\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u51cf\u5c112041\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FLoRG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u805a\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002"}}

The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedClarify enhances medical diagnostics by generating follow-up questions that improve decision-making and reduce errors by ~27 p.p.", "motivation": "Existing medical LLMs struggle with generating informative follow-up questions during diagnosis, which is crucial for effective clinical reasoning.", "method": "The study introduces MedClarify, an AI agent that generates follow-up questions based on candidate diagnoses and information gain to aid in diagnostic reasoning.", "result": "MedClarify reduces diagnostic errors by approximately 27 percentage points compared to conventional single-shot LLMs, showing its efficacy in iterative reasoning.", "conclusion": "MedClarify significantly improves the diagnostic performance of medical LLMs by generating effective follow-up questions, leading to a reduction in diagnostic errors."}}

To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator.

Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample.

In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space.

Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable.

Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content.

In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers.

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting.

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13.

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5ZO-Muon\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670dZO\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ZO-Muon\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u56fe\u548cMuons\u98ce\u683c\u5149\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8ZO\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97ZO\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "ZO-Muon\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u67e5\u8be2/\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u8d62\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks.

In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency.

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SWIN Transformer\u548cCNN\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8COVID-19\u548c\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u7740\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408SWIN Transformer\u548c\u591a\u79cdCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DenseNet201\u3001Inception V3\u548cVGG 19\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Tensorflow\u548cKeras\u7b49\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bCOVID-19\u548c\u80ba\u708e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u9ad8\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408FL\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8COVID-19\u548c\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528Wasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u6574\u5f62\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8109\u51b2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8109\u51b2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u4e2d\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8109\u51b2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8109\u51b2\u6574\u5f62\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8109\u51b2\u6574\u5f62\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c0f\u4f20\u7edf\u8109\u51b2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u8109\u51b2\u5bb6\u65cf\u5982\u9ad8\u9636\u9ad8\u65af\u8109\u51b2\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u957f\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u8109\u51b2\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8109\u51b2\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8109\u51b2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u8109\u51b2\u5e76\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0b\u6e38\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u6574\u5f62\u7684\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u675f\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning.

Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL.

Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization.

The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology.

We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths.

Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data.

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-\u0398(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$.

Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles.

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks.

To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions.

We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models.

But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models.

While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time.

However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training.

Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants.

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification.

These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics.

In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation.
