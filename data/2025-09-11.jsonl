Visualizing such manifolds can help with\nillustrating their topological characteristics (e.g., curvature) and providing\ninsights into important properties of the underlying data (e.g., anomalies in\nthe measurements). In this paper, we describe a new methodology and system for\ngenerating and visualizing manifolds that are inferred from actual Internet\nlatency measurements between different cities and are projected over a 2D\nEuclidean space (e.g., a geographic map). Our method leverages a series of\ngraphs that capture critical information contained in the data, including\nwell-defined locations (for vertices) and Ricci curvature information (for\nedges). Our visualization approach then generates a curved surface (manifold)\nin which (a) geographical locations of vertices are maintained and (b) the\nRicci curvature values of the graph edges determine the curvature properties of\nthe manifold. The resulting manifold highlights areas of critical connectivity\nand defines an instance of \"Internet delay space\" where latency measurements\nmanifest as geodesics. We describe details of our method and its implementation\nin a tool, which we call Matisse, for generating, visualizing and manipulating\nmanifolds projected onto a base map.

The framework enhances Large\nLanguage Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently\nexploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context\nmemory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying\nenvironment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance.

For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the\nclients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round\ncommunication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy.

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align\nwith the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and\nhallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating\nfurther alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nThought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied\ndecision-making.

It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning\nprocess, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by\nincorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes\nconsistency constraints on the model output.

While AI systems can now both make\ndecisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly\nbeen studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a\ndual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence\nreward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy\nthat suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that\nprocesses these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide\ndecisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements\nwhile maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement\nthis architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive\nboth policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The\nplatform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental\ncomplexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement\nlearning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic\ndecision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action\nselection patterns.

However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where\nByzantine clients compromise the integrity of the global model by submitting\nmalicious updates. Robust aggregation methods have been widely adopted to\nmitigate such threats, relying on the core assumption that malicious updates\nare inherently out-of-distribution and can therefore be identified and excluded\nbefore aggregating client updates. In this paper, we challenge this underlying\nassumption by showing that a model can be poisoned while keeping malicious\nupdates within the main distribution. We propose Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP),\nan adaptive and evasive poisoning strategy that exploits side-channel feedback\nfrom the aggregation process to guide the attack. Specifically, the adversary\ncontinuously infers whether its malicious contribution has been incorporated\ninto the global model and adapts accordingly. This enables a dynamic adjustment\nof the local loss function, balancing a malicious component with a camouflaging\ncomponent, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the poisoning while evading\nrobust aggregation defenses.

For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget.

In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are\njust like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model\nDegradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;\nSide 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail\nto preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation\nsubspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and\ngenerate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM\noptimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical\ninvestigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and\nRegularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -\n(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic\nfusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve\ninformation capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which\nutilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision\nin our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT\nadheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.\nCompared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains\ndemonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,\nand zero-shot scenarios."}

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur.

Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first\narchitecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple\ndimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A\none-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and\nphase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,\nseparable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we\nevaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,\nincluding benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of\nOptimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the\nperformance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established\narchitectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs."}

Preprint. Correspondence: alijanpour@ucf.edu", "summary": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in\nchildren that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and\ncareer life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients\nand the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction\nand refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding\nin interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of\nDL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency."}

Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into\nstudent with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we\npropose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that\nalternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and\nweight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math\nbenchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a\nQwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,\nQWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT\nconsistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive\nmulti-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating\noverfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level\nteachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general\nreasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating\nthat consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results\nposition MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT\ncapabilities from diverse teachers into compact students."}

Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and\ndisruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for\nremote or resource-limited apiaries.

We further examine supporting resources, including\npublicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for\nembedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.\nCritical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and\ndeployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside\nemerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge\nlearning, and dataset standardization.
