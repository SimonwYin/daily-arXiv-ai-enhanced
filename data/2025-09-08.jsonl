However, existing diffusion parallelism\ninference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU\nenvironments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause\nworkload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion\nInference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in\nsuch settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained\nparallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI\nintroduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup\nphases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to\nreduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further\nminimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism\nmechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to\ntheir computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through\na complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both\nload-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,\ndemonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance\nbottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion\ninference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference\nlatency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on\nheterogeneous GPUs."}

Security Consequences of Residential IPv6 Transition", "comment": null, "summary": "IPv4 NAT has limited the spread of IoT botnets considerably by\ndefault-denying bots' incoming connection requests to in-home devices unless\nthe owner has explicitly allowed them. As the Internet transitions to majority\nIPv6, however, residential connections no longer require the use of NAT. This\npaper therefore asks: has the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 ultimately made\nresidential networks more vulnerable to attack, thereby empowering the next\ngeneration of IPv6-based IoT botnets? To answer this question, we introduce a\nlarge-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can\nbe run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets. We use this methodology\nto perform the largest-scale measurement of IPv6 residential networks to date,\nand compare which devices are publicly accessible to comparable IPv4 networks.\nWe were able to receive responses from 14.0M distinct IPv6 addresses inside of\nresidential networks (i.e., not the external-facing gateway), in 2,436 ASes\nacross 118 countries. These responses come from protocols commonly exploited by\nIoT botnets (including telnet and FTP), as well as protocols typically\nassociated with end-user devices (including iPhone-Sync and IPP). Comparing to\nIPv4, we show that we are able to reach more printers, iPhones, and smart\nlights over IPv6 than full IPv4-wide scans could. Collectively, our results\nshow that NAT has indeed acted as the de facto firewall of the Internet, and\nthe v4-to-v6 transition of residential networks is opening up new devices to\nattack."}

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric\nforms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited\nto simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new\ninput-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new\nbehaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We\ntarget this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal\ndecision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires\nmodels flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich\nexternal stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first\npropose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of\npolicy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering\nground-truth rules in simulation.

To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost.

For emission\nprediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and\nPiperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods.

In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL).
