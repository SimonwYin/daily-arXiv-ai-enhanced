Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and\nLow Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G\nsystems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use\ncase to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability\nin the range of 99.999\\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two\ntargets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of\nwork have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In\nthis article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are\nanalysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of\nlatency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is\ntaken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross\nlayer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design\nconsideration for various 5G and beyond verticals.

Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN\nperformance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper\nintroduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov\nDecision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)\nalgorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding\ndecisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of\nunsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation\namong competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a\nlearning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback\nand probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that\nDRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,\nRFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest\nSatisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load\nbalancing.

Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core\ninstead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting\nnew allocator designs.

As a result, these\ncounterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.\n  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that\nproduces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable\noutcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome.

To address\nthis gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are\nwell-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the\ncomplex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,\na detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain\ncoordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph\nrepresentation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn\nfine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path\nattention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling\nprecise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51\nreal-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an\naverage F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field\nshould be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,\ngathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its\ncontent into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable\nto bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied\nremedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate\nover-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks.

As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies."}

ArgRAG\nconstructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning\nunder gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting\ndecisions.

However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --\nclarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable\nsteps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.\nCounterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and\n`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).\n  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore\ncausal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all\ninterventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical\nscenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these\ncounterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.\n  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that\nproduces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable\noutcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both\nlimitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features\nand 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and\ncausally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system\ns(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen\nautomatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost\n(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,\nresulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal\nplanner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can\ngenerate illegal actions."}

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either\nconsiderable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central\nidea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of\ntransformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple\nsmaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are\naggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem\nto minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous\nhardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the\noptimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively\ncalibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the\ncapability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge\ndevices, achieving up to 3.1$\\times$ inference speedup with large transformer\nmodels. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6\nbillion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\\%.\nCoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\\% while\nmaintaining satisfactory inference performance."}
