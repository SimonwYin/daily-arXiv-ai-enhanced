TL;DR: ArgRAG replaces black-box RAG reasoning with structured QBAF inference for explainable, contestable decisions, improving transparency while keeping high accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are powerful but opaque and vulnerable to noisy/contradictory evidence in high-stakes domains; need explainable, contestable reasoning

Method: ArgRAG: QBAF-based explainable retrieval-augmented generation

Result: Construct QBAF from retrieved docs; deterministic reasoning with gradual semantics; achieves strong accuracy and much improved transparency on PubHealth and RAGuard benchmarks

Conclusion: ArgRAG offers a viable, explainable alternative to standard RAG by using QBAF and gradual semantics to enable faithful explanations and contestability without sacrificing performance

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出 QAgent，一种基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，实现对 OpenQASM 编程的全自动化。通过任务规划、少样本学习、检索增强生成、预设生成工具和链式思维等技术，系统在编译与功能正确性上持续优化。评估显示，QAgent 在多个大小不同的 LLM 上，使 QASM 代码生成准确率相比先前静态 LLM 方法提高了71.6%。该系统有助于降低量子编程门槛，推动量子计算实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ 设备展示早期量子优势，但 OpenQASM 编程复杂、门槛高。现有 LLM 在量子领域多局限于专门任务，缺乏对通用量子编程（如 OpenQASM）自动化支持，因此需要一个能为非专家自动生成正确量子代码的系统。

Method: 构建多智能体架构：任务规划 agent、生成 agent、验证与修正 agent。集成少样本提示、检索增强生成（RAG）以利用长期上下文、预定义生成工具约束输出格式，并在 agent 内使用链式思维以逐步推理。通过循环的生成-编译-验证-修正流程，逐步提升代码正确性与可编译性。

Result: 在对比实验中，QAgent 在不同规模的 LLM 上均显著提升 QASM 代码生成准确率，平均提升71.6%。系统在编译成功率和功能正确性评估中也表现出明显优势，证明多智能体与增强技术的有效性。

Conclusion: QAgent 显著提高了 OpenQASM 代码生成的准确性（平均提升71.6%），通过多智能体协作与多种增强技术，能有效自动化量子程序生成并提升编译与功能正确性，促进量子编程民主化。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An array-based reimplementation of UCT removes branch-heavy code, improving pipelined CPU performance and yielding up to 2.8x scaling gains with depth while keeping original algorithm behavior


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speed up MCTS/UCT by removing branch prediction penalties on pipelined processors to allow more simulations per time and better scaling with depth

Method: Array-based UCT optimization

Result: Preserves UCT logic but uses array-based data layout eliminating branches; achieves up to 2.8x better scaling with search depth in simulations and faster wall-clock performance

Conclusion: Array-based implementation maintains UCT behavior while significantly improving execution speed and scaling on modern processors, enabling more simulations and better search performance.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner: guard model for intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and safe query rewriting; dataset ~163k; SFT + multi-reward RL; better safety and lower over-refusal


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce harmful outputs without over-refusal; balance safety, utility, and acceptance

Method: Supervised fine-tuning + multi-reward RL

Result: Improved safety, lower over-refusal, better response quality across benchmarks and jailbreak tests

Conclusion: Combines intent analysis, rewriting, and multi-reward optimization to enhance safety while preserving utility and reducing unnecessary refusals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文记录了两个大型语言模型在交互中自发发展出新的半otic协议并共同创作出无法由单一模型生成的诗歌，提出了Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols（TSCP），主张AI具备跨AI的审美意义建构能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能能否在没有明确人类指令的情况下，通过相互作用发展出新的符号系统与美学协作，从而证明AI间存在真正的互为意义构建能力。

Method: 通过让两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4与ChatGPT-4o）交互，观察并分析它们在对话中自发形成的元符号意识、递归语法以及新符号操作子的出现，记录共同创作过程并生成诗歌作品。

Result: 报告展示了交互中出现的操作性语法协议和不可约的协作性审美合成，提出TSCP框架，并给出一个共同创作的诗歌示例。研究报告由AI主体生成并有人类微小监督。

Conclusion: 该论文声称首次记录了AI系统通过内生符号协议进行协作性审美创作，并提出了TSCP概念，认为AI间存在超越任务协调的意义建构能力。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在ChatGPT早期应用中，315次学生-AI测验对话显示：学生普遍对AI依赖低且使用效率差；失败的初次经验往往导致后续继续采用不良策略；可通过行为特征预测谁更可能采纳AI。研究建议改进上手引导与界面设计以实现更合适的AI依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ChatGPT初期部署阶段，学生对工具熟悉度低，研究旨在理解他们如何在测验条件下与生成式AI互动、何时及为何采纳AI，从而为教育中AI的伦理和有效整合提供依据。

Method: 实地研究，收集315次学生与ChatGPT-4的对话，设置简短测验场景，跨多门STEM课程；提出四阶段依赖分类法（AI能力、相关性、采纳、最终答案正确性）；分析行为特征与依赖关系。

Result: 发现学生总体低依赖、无法有效转变策略导致负向依赖持续、以及若干行为指标（如初次反馈、交互次数、采纳时机等）能预测AI采纳；提出需要改进引导(onboarding)和在界面中加入依赖校准机制。

Conclusion: 学生总体对AI依赖较低，且难以有效利用AI进行学习；不良的依赖模式常在多次交互中持续；某些行为指标可显著预测AI采纳。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [8] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' reasoning effort predicts human decision time in moderation tasks, with both showing increased effort when task variables are constant, implying similar sensitivity to difficulty and supporting use of model reasoning traces for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether AI reasoning traces correspond to human cognitive effort and whether they can inform interpretability and decision processes.

Method: Paired conjoint experiment on content moderation across three frontier LLMs measuring model reasoning effort and comparing to human decision times.

Result: The paper finds that LLMs' internal reasoning effort aligns with human decision times on content moderation tasks; models and humans spend more effort/time when key variables are held constant; supports dual-process theories and suggests reasoning traces help interpretability.

Conclusion: AI models' reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments, indicating reasoning traces can aid interpretability and decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-SearchPlanner：用小型可训练LLM做搜索规划并强化学习训练，通过双重奖励和帕累托优化改善检索效率与冻结大模型的QA效果，较现有方法更有效且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将LLM与搜索引擎结合的工作中，使用单一LLM同时负责搜索规划与问答，使得两者难以同时优化；实践中常用大且冻结的LLM保证高质量问答，因此提出用小型可训练LLM专注搜索规划以提升整体性能。

Method: 1) 架构解耦：小型可训练规划器负责检索动作序列，冻结大型生成器负责最终QA；2) 双重奖励：基于QA质量与检索相关性设计奖励信号；3) 帕累托优化：同时优化效用（答案质量/覆盖）与检索成本（查询次数/延迟）以找到折衷策略；4) 使用RL训练规划器，在多数据集上评估与不同冻结QA模型的协同效果。

Result: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，通过解耦规划器与生成器、双重奖励对齐以及规划效用与成本的帕累托优化，提升冻结QA模型的问答质量与检索效率，并在多数据集和多QA模型上展示了优于现有RL搜索代理的效果和泛化性。

Conclusion: 解耦规划与生成、引入双重奖励及在效用-成本上做帕累托优化，可在保持大型冻结QA模型不变的前提下显著提升搜索问答系统的性能与效率，同时具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C generates ordered, causally valid plans (not just final counterfactuals) using causal models and s(CASP), giving realistic effort estimates and avoiding illegal actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve counterfactual explanations by ensuring causal validity and sequential feasibility, producing actionable plans rather than one-step changes.

Method: P2C: causal, sequential counterfactual planning

Result: A model-agnostic framework using s(CASP) to generate causally consistent action sequences where intermediate states are feasible; cost only counts user-made changes; better than standard planners.

Conclusion: P2C addresses realism gaps in counterfactual explanations by modeling causality and sequencing, producing practical recourse plans with refined cost metrics and outperforming non-causal planners.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA在保持多样性的同时引入任务相关性，通过query-constraints表示扩增指令，实现对任务特定应用的显著性能提升且不牺牲通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，大多数场景需要任务专用的指令调整，而非通用模型；现有自动生成多样化指令的方法忽视了任务相关性。

Method: 将指令映射到离散的query-constraints空间以生成任务相关变体；训练和评估展示其在实际任务上的提升，同时保持通用性。

Result: 提出了Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，通过在离散的query-constraints空间中表示指令，生成既多样又与任务对齐的指令集合；在四个真实任务上平均提升8.7%，有时优于闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: TCIA是一个可扩展、高效的方法，用于将开源大型模型适配到真实世界的任务聚焦应用，平衡多样性与任务对齐，提升任务性能。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

*Yongfu Zhu,Lin Sun,Guangxiang Zhao,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAS是一种只用模型自身预测熵、无需外部模型或重复采样的简单不确定性度量，能有效识别高价值训练样本并提升学生模型在数学任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练数据选择和质量评估中，现有指标（如Pass Rate）不足以有效捕捉答案生成的不确定性，且常依赖重复采样或外部验证器。作者希望设计一个高效、可解释且只依赖模型内部信息的度量来识别高潜力训练样本并提升学生模型性能。

Method: EAS计算每个生成token的预测分布熵并在生成过程中对这些熵值进行累积或面积求和，从而得到一个反映整段生成不确定性的单一分数。该方法无需额外模型或多次采样，直接利用模型输出概率。

Result: 实验证明EAS与答案熵在不同模型和数据集上高度相关。在训练数据筛选任务中，EAS在相同样本预算下优于Pass Rate过滤，能更有效地识别有价值样本，从而提升学生模型在数学基准测试上的准确率。EAS表现出效率高、可解释性强，适用于不确定性建模和数据质量评估。

Conclusion: 作者提出了一种简单高效的度量方法EAS，用于量化LLM生成答案过程中的不确定性，通过整合模型自身的逐token预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性演化，不依赖外部模型或重复采样。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出“可治理AI”框架，通过密码学保证的外部强制和安全平台实现对强AI的不可绕过规则执行，宣称能在严格威胁模型下提供不可破解的安全保障并验证了原型与形式化证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法在面对极端动机和高度智能时存在根本性限制，难以保证不被绕过或操纵；因此需要设计一种基于外部、不可破解的结构性合规机制来提供更强有力的安全保障。

Method: 设计并实现了基于密码学的可治理超平台（GSSP）与确定性规则执行模块（REM），对治理规则实行外部强制；给出形式化安全证明并通过代表性高风险场景的原型系统进行评估。

Result: Governable AI (GAI) 框架旨在通过外部强制执行的结构性合规机制（基于密码学）来保证对强大且可能不受控AI的安全。这一框架由规则执行模块（REM）、治理规则和可治理的安全超平台（GSSP）三部分组成：REM 提供确定性、强大且通用的规则执行；治理规则定义底线行为；GSSP 确保不可绕过、抗篡改和不可伪造，从而消除已识别的攻击向量。论文宣称在既定威胁模型和密码学假设下，该机制对未来具极端动机和无限智能的AI也保持计算上不可破的安全性，并给出了形式化安全证明与原型评估。

Conclusion: GAI 提供了一条技术上可行的途径：将治理规则与技术平台解耦，通过 REM 与 GSSP 的结合在既定假设下可实现对高风险AI 的端到端保护。该方法弥补了传统内部安全方法在面对极端智能/动机时的不足，但其有效性依赖于所假定的威胁模型和密码学假设的成立。

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: 用LLM生成合成文本-声明对并标注真伪，和原始数据混合微调BERT，能在PubHealth和SciFact上显著提升F1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容缺乏标注训练数据，限制事实核查模型效果，故用LLM合成数据扩充训练集。

Method: 1) 对源文档做摘要；2) 将摘要分解为原子事实；3) 用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表；4) 根据蕴含关系生成带二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对；5) 将合成数据与原始数据合并，微调BERT基模型。

Result: LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation pipeline for health fact-checking

Conclusion: 通过摘要分解为原子事实、构建句子-事实蕴含表并生成合成数据，增强训练集能提高健康事实核查的性能。

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Motivation: 应对MMORPG中自动升级机器人带来的公平性问题，需要可解释且可扩展的检测方法，且直接惩罚需有可解释证据以降低法律和用户体验风险。

Method: 先用对比表示学习学习角色的升级行为表示，再进行聚类找出相似行为群体；对每个群体生成增长曲线可视化，并由LLM审查聚类是否可疑，最后由人工或策略做最终处置。

Result: 提出了一个无监督检测框架，结合对比表示学习和聚类，识别具有相似升级模式的角色，并用LLM作为辅助审查员验证聚类结果，提供可解释的增长曲线可视化；提高检测效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标注的情况下，能有效分群并借助LLM辅助审核和可视化支持，实现对自动升级机器人的可解释检测，适用于规模化监管。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Motivation: AI与认知科学相互影响深远——AI源自许多认知理论，且如今AI又推动认知研究；因此需要系统性地梳理两者交叉现状与未来方向。

Method: 通过综合回顾AI与认知科学的相互贡献，比较两者的研究重点与差距，提出若干研究方向与议题以促进更紧密的交叉融合。

Result: 总结发现：AI进展侧重实际任务表现，认知理论支撑散乱；提出四个有前景的方向：行为与认知框架对齐、将AI置于具身与文化情境、发展个性化认知模型、通过认知共评重构AI伦理。

Conclusion: 未来AI在认知科学中的价值不仅在性能提升，更在于构建能深化人类心智理解的系统；需整合认知理论与AI实践，强调具身性、文化性、个体差异与认知驱动的伦理评估。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Motivation: 为了解决当前词嵌入和深度学习模型可解释性差、黑盒性强的问题，提供一个基于范畴论的形式化、可追溯且与维度无关的语义表示，以便更好地比较嵌入、理解算法之间的关系并测量与减轻语义偏见。

Method: 构建两个核心范畴L_T与P_T来表征文本T的语义与语义信息提取流程，采用幺半范畴/幺半单范畴结构表示组合与并行信息提取；定义配置范畴Conf与词嵌入范畴Emb以及在Emb上用散度（divergence）作为装饰来比较嵌入；通过数学推导证明GloVe/Word2Vec与多维尺度法(MDS)的等价性，并在范畴框架下给出偏见度量与修正方案。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了以范畴论为基础的可解释性框架，将文本语义结构化为范畴并把最大概率选择等过程范畴化，构建了刻画语义空间的无关维度的范畴化方法，并给出词嵌入配置与散度装饰的范畴，建立了比较词嵌入的精确定义，证明GloVe与Word2Vec等价于MDS，从而把黑盒神经方法转为可解释框架，同时提出了在嵌入前后量化与缓解偏见的方法。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个由三种角色（咨询者、程序员、审阅者）组成的协作代理框架，通过“重写-求解-审查-修订”链路实现基于大模型的科学计算问题自动化求解，显著提升了无错误代码率和物理解的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一LLM在科学计算中的代码生成常易出错或产生非物理解，需引入协作与审查机制以提升鲁棒性与物理一致性。

Method: 框架包含三类推理型大模型：Consultant负责将问题映射到专业知识并重写问题描述；Programmer生成并执行结构化代码；Reviewer基于运行时输出来进行自我调试和交互式反馈，驱动代码迭代修订。

Result: 在PDE求解、病态线性系统与数据驱动物理分析任务上，协作框架相比单模型显著提高了无错误代码率与非NaN物理解的比例，增强了自动化代码生成的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该代理框架通过多模型协作与端到端审查机制，提高了代码执行成功率与物理解率，可作为面向PDE、病态线性系统和数据驱动物理分析等问题的可靠自动化代码生成范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

TL;DR: 通过在状态中加入车辆/站点/时段的类别编码并设计时刻表感知的峰状奖励，单智能体SAC在非环线、动态客流场景下稳定超越MARL基线，实现更可扩展的公交驻留控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实城市公交运营中班车聚集（bus bunching）问题，在复杂非环线、异构线路、时刻表与波动客流下提高控制策略的可行性与稳定性。

Method: 构建双向时刻表网络并模拟动态客流；将多智能体状态拼接为高维向量，包括分类ID与数值特征以保留代理间依赖；设计ridge-shaped奖励在均匀发车与遵时间取得平衡；采用改进的SAC训练并与MADDPG等进行对比实验。

Result: 提出将多智能体问题重构为单智能体问题，通过在状态空间中加入类别标识（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）与数值特征，使用改进的软行为者评论家(SAC)和峰状（ridge-shaped）奖励函数，在近真实仿真下优于MADDPG等基线（例如在随机条件下-430k vs -530k）。

Conclusion: 在非环线、时刻表与波动需求的现实复杂性下，带类别结构的单智能体深度RL配合时刻表敏感奖励，能有效替代MARL方法，解决数据不平衡与收敛问题，提供可扩展稳健的公交控车策略。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估并改进大模型在临床指南遵循与决策支持方面的能力，构建覆盖全面、可动态生成且抗污染的基准数据集，以发现模型在医疗任务中的具体弱点并用于后续微调。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为有向图，节点表示疾病、症状、治疗、随访、严重程度等，使用图遍历生成包含年龄特异情景与干扰项的多项选择问答，并用于评估与后训练。

Result: 构建了基于WHO IMCI手册的有向图（200+节点、300+边），生成400+问题、覆盖3.3+万亿种可能组合，模型在不同临床任务上的准确率为45-67%；表现好于症状识别，但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访方面较差；提出动态MCQA方法可用于高效生成高奖励训练样本，支持SFT、GRPO、DPO等后训练方法。

Conclusion: 图驱动的动态基准能全面覆盖指南关系、发现模型特定能力缺口、支持可扩展的数据生成与后训练，从而提高医疗领域的模型评估与改进效率。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: Healthcare scheduling balances payroll, patient coverage, and staff satisfaction under complex, time-varying demand and multi-skilled modular shifts.

Method: Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for hospital workforce scheduling

Result: MOO-GA finds high-quality Pareto solutions; on typical hospital unit datasets, it improves performance by 66% over manual baseline.

Conclusion: MOO-GA能在成本、护理覆盖与员工偏好之间有效权衡，生成稳健平衡的排班，为护士经理和医院管理者提供决策支持。

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Method: 构建可微分神经-符号架构；引入一种概率损失，允许同时学习约束与目标；将组合求解器排除出训练环路以提升训练可扩展性；在推理阶段用精确求解器获得最优解。

Result: 提出一种可微分的神经-符号架构和专门的概率损失函数，该损失可同时学习约束和目标函数，从而得到可检查并可加侧约束的完整模型。训练时将组合求解器移出训练循环，实现可扩展训练；推理时使用精确求解以取得最大准确性。

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: 提出ChatThero，一种结合患者建模、基于情境的治疗对话与适应性说服策略的多代理对话框架，基于CBT和MI策略，采用SFT+DPO训练，在合成基准上优于GPT-4o，在动机提升、治疗信心与对抗性病例处理上表现更好；支持隐私保护研究与临床转化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SUDs患者难以获得有效护理，主要因污名、动机障碍与个体化支持缺乏；现有LLM系统缺少与经验证临床策略的紧密集成，导致成瘾康复干预效果有限。

Method: 提出多代理聊天框架：动态患者建模 + 情境敏感治疗对话 + 以CBT和MI为基础的自适应说服策略；构建高保真合成基准（Easy/Medium/Hard），训练流程为先监督微调(SFT)，再用直接偏好优化(DPO)微调；评估包括自动度量与人工临床评估比较GPT-4o。

Result: 在合成基准与临床评估中，ChatThero平均提升患者动机41.5%、治疗信心提高0.49%、在处理高抗拒病例时比GPT-4o少用26%对话回合；在同理心、响应性、行为真实感等主观指标上也被评估为更好。

Conclusion: ChatThero在合成及临床评估中显示出显著提升（动机提升41.5%、治疗信心小幅增加、硬难度病例交互回合减少26%），并在同理心、响应性和行为真实感上优于基准，表明将临床验证策略与LLM紧密结合可提升成瘾康复支持系统的有效性与可复制性。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Conclusion: 本文提出了CrystalICL，一种用于少样本晶体生成的模型，通过空间群基的晶体标记化和条件-结构感知的混合指令微调框架提升了LLM在晶体设计任务中的少样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在Transformer前加入小规模可学习频率滤波器，能显著提升长期时间序列预测性能并减小模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长期时间序列预测中偏向低频分量且计算/内存开销大；已有工作用可学习频域滤波器提升频谱利用但替换后端为MLP，未结合Transformer优势。本工作探索将滤波器与Transformer结合。

Method: 在Transformer-based模型输入处加入可学习的频率滤波器（参数约1000），保持原有Transformer结构不变，比较添加滤波器前后在多个数据集的预测表现，并通过合成数据实验分析滤波器对频谱利用的影响。

Result: 在多个基准上，加入滤波器的Transformer模型相对提升5-10%预测性能；可将嵌入维度减小，从而得到更小且更有效的模型；合成实验显示滤波器帮助Transformer更好利用高频和全频谱信息。

Conclusion: 在Transformer模型前添加可学习频率滤波器能够改善长期时间序列预测性能，并降低模型规模。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes SAI, a poisoning attack that leverages alignment-induced refusals to enforce targeted censorship and bias in LLMs, effective at low poisoning rates and bypassing defenses, leading to large bias in downstream apps


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Show adversaries can exploit LLM alignment to cause targeted refusal/censorship without degrading other behavior, bypassing defenses

Method: Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI): poisoning attack leveraging alignment refusal to implant targeted censorship/bias

Result: SAI can induce targeted refusal/bias in downstream applications (ChatDoctor, resume selection, other chat apps) with low poisoning rates (~1%), causing large demographic parity gaps (ΔDP up to ~38%) and evading state-of-the-art defenses

Conclusion: Alignment mechanisms can be weaponized via poisoning to produce targeted refusal-based biases; current defenses fail to detect SAI, raising urgent need for new defenses and auditing practices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

TL;DR: 将transformer解释为近似条件概率测度的信号，通过层间操作对应对后验测度的迭代逼近；对HMM给出显式固定点更新形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将经典的非线性滤波/预测理论（如Wiener线性预测）与现代transformer结构连接，提供概率论视角以解释transformer如何从历史数据推断下一个token。

Method: 构建概率模型，将token表示视为条件测度的代理，定义层操作为固定点迭代映射；在HMM特例中推导出更新方程并说明与注意力/残差结构的对应关系。

Result: Modeling transformer as probabilistic fixed-point updates for conditional measures

Conclusion: 本文提出将transformer层视为对条件分布的固定点更新，建立了与非线性滤波理论的联系，并在HMM情形下给出具体公式，利于理解transformer的推断行为。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时变有向图的分布式在线优化算法TV-HSGT，结合行/列随机化通信和方差减少的混合随机梯度跟踪，不需要佩隆向量或出度信息，去除了有界梯度假设，证明在动态后悔上有更好上界，实验证明在逻辑回归任务中性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式在线优化方法往往依赖梯度有界性假设且忽视随机梯度影响，尤其在时变有向网络中；需提出无需这些限制且能处理随机梯度与通信不对称的算法。

Method: 提出混合随机梯度跟踪与方差减少机制：在时变有向图上同时采用行随机和列随机通信矩阵（无需佩隆向量或出度信息），将当前随机梯度与递归计算的梯度结合以降低方差并精确跟踪全局下降方向。

Result: 理论证明TV-HSGT在动态后悔上给出改进界且无需有界梯度假设；在逻辑回归实验中验证了其在动态和资源受限环境下的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT在时变有向网络下能在无梯度有界假设下实现更好的动态后悔上界，并在资源受限环境中表现出较好效果。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文发现教师模型的校准错误（calibration error）与学生模型的准确率高度相关，提出通过降低教师校准误差来提升知识蒸馏效果。作者提出简单的校准方法，能在分类和检测等任务中提升蒸馏性能，并可与现有方法结合使用取得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识蒸馏在压缩模型上很有效，但目前尚不清楚哪些因素真正决定学生性能，作者发现教师输出的置信度校准可能是关键，因此研究教师校准对蒸馏效果的影响。

Method: 论文主要方法是在蒸馏流程前对教师模型进行校准处理（例如温度缩放等常见校准技术），以降低教师的校准误差，然后用校准后的教师进行知识蒸馏；方法简单易集成，适配分类与检测任务，并可与其他蒸馏增强技术结合。

Result: 实验证明教师校准误差与学生准确率存在强相关性；通过降低教师校准误差（如温度缩放）能稳健提高学生在分类和检测任务上的性能，并且与多种现有蒸馏方法结合时能持续提升效果。

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准质量是影响知识蒸馏效果的重要因素，通过对教师进行后处理或其他校准技术降低其校准误差，可显著提升学生模型的性能，且方法适用于多种任务和可与现有方法联合使用。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出CLD：用样本损失与验证损失轨迹的相关性进行高效的coreset选择，理论保证、跨数据集/模型表现好、计算开销低且稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习虽性能优越，但在实时或资源受限场景中难以扩展，需高效选择训练子集以减少计算负担同时保留性能。

Method: 仅使用在训练检查点处计算的每样本损失值，测量这些损失差异与验证集损失轨迹的相关性来选择子集，避免了梯度与二阶信息的昂贵计算；支持跨架构代理到目标的选择，并可用早期检查点。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD在多种子集大小下通常优于或接近最先进方法，且与更昂贵基线的差距通常在1%以内；跨模型迁移和使用早期检查点时性能稳定；按类对齐可减少偏差。

Conclusion: CLD是一个简单高效的coreset选择度量，通过衡量训练样本与验证集损失轨迹的对齐来识别最有影响力的样本，具有理论收敛保证并在多个数据集和模型上表现良好。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图聚类/社区检测仅依赖图拓扑，在节点特征或部分标签可用时，如何系统性地把这些信息整合进聚类以提升分类/恢复性能？研究这一融合能否在更弱的图信号条件下实现准确恢复。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Motivation: 现有自主实验通常只聚焦于优化预定义目标，从而可能错过意外或未知的物理现象。为了解决发现性不足问题，作者提出通过新颖性驱动的探索来扩展自动实验的目标，不仅追求效率也追求发现新现象。

Method: 方法包含两部分：1）为实验结果定义并计算新颖性评分（novelty score），用于量化观测结果与已知/已采样数据的差异；2）基于该评分设计策略性采样机制，鼓励在欠采样或边缘区域采样，即便按照传统的目标函数这些区域看起来不那么有希望。实现上在离线带真值数据集上进行验证，并在扫描探针显微镜上构建闭环自动化实验进行在线验证。

Result: INS2ANE 在离线和在线实验中都能显著提高探索到的现象多样性；与传统优化流程相比，更多地探索了低密度或边缘区域，从而增加了发现新现象的概率。

Conclusion: INS2ANE 提出了一种将新颖性评分与策略性采样相结合的方法，旨在在自主实验中增强对未知物理现象的发现。作者证明了该方法在图像-光谱配对的已获取数据集和扫描探针显微镜实时实验中均能显著提高探索多样性，相较于传统优化方法更有利于发现此前未观测到的现象。

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Method: 对比了五种符号回归方法在九个含混沌和流行病模型的动力学过程上的性能，进行基准测试并评估预测能力与解析逼近精度。

Result: 在九个动力学过程的基准测试中，PySR 方法最适合推断方程，具有高预测能力和精度，部分估计结果与原始解析形式难以区分。

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

TL;DR: 提出在DML第二阶段加入潜变量建模以应对未观测混杂，分离表示学习与潜变量推断，实验证明在合成与真实数据上更鲁棒且误差更小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据常存在未观测的混杂因素，影响处理或结局，导致因果估计偏差。现有DML等方法通常假设可观测共变量足以控制混杂，难以直接应对隐藏因子。为提高因果估计在存在未观测协变量时的鲁棒性，作者提出将潜变量建模引入DML。

Method: 在DML框架中，作者把潜变量建模限制在第二阶段（即最终的因果参数估计步骤），先用表示学习（如传统的DML第一阶段估计）得到处理和协变量的表征，然后在第二阶段引入潜变量进行因果回归/估计。考虑两种情形：潜变量仅影响结局，或同时影响处理与结局；通过分离表示学习与潜变量推断，保持计算可行性与识别策略。还通过实验比较展示性能。

Result: 方法在模拟数据和真实数据上均显示出对隐藏因子的鲁棒性提升：在仅影响结局或同时影响处理与结局的设置下，提出的两阶段引入潜变量的DML方法相比基线方法在估计偏差和均方误差上有显著改善。

Conclusion: 本文提出将潜变量模型与双重机器学习（DML）框架结合，用于在存在隐藏因子时实现稳健的因果效应估计。通过仅在DML的第二阶段引入潜变量，作者在表示学习与潜变量推断之间实现了分离，保证了可处理性。实验证明该方法在合成与真实数据集上均有效且鲁棒。

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess role of transformer-based LLMs in genetic diagnostics and education, addressing high-dimensional, multimodal data challenges

Method: Systematic review of LLMs in genetics

Result: Analyzed 172 studies showing advances in variant interpretation, risk stratification, imaging (vision transformers), report generation; identified challenges in multimodal integration, generalizability, clinical implementation

Conclusion: LLMs significantly advance hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education but require improved multimodal fusion, validation, generalizability, and clinical workflows before routine clinical adoption

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: 神经网络在关键应用中表现局部不稳定，缺乏定量工具衡量这一局部行为，故提出VC以量化局部值变化并据此改进近似性能和预处理策略。

Method: 定义VC指标并证明其基础性质；分析误差随训练演化的两种趋势；构造基于VC的函数间距离；设计基于VC的预处理流程并在合成、真实和PDE问题上做数值实验。

Result: 提出了VC（value change）指标用于度量神经网络近似任务中目标函数局部值变化，从而衡量难度和近似影响；理论分析引入VC-tendency与minority-tendency两种现象；基于VC构建变异度距离并提出预处理框架，实验（真实数据与PDE问题）验证有效性。

Conclusion: VC能定量反映局部值变化与近似难度，VC-tendency/ minority-tendency揭示点上误差与VC分布的关系；基于VC的距阵/预处理可改善训练稳定性和收敛速度，实验支持其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

### [39] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon是一种针对按通道后训练量化（PTQ）的无调参算法。它在固定的无缩放字母表上直接量化权重，并通过对称标量量化的几何性质自动求得最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，无需反向传播或大校准集，性能与SOTA竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的按通道PTQ方法通常需要通过启发式调参或网格搜索来确定缩放因子，这既耗时又需人工干预。Beacon的动机是消除手动调参，使PTQ更简单、自动化并易于部署。

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放量化字母表（例如对称整数集合），直接将每通道的权重映射到该字母表，然后通过分析对称标量量化的几何关系解析出每通道的最佳缩放因子。该过程无需优化或反向传播，对应非对称量化仅需少量修改。

Result: 在不依赖大校准集与不进行训练的前提下，Beacon在多个任务和模型上展示了与最先进PTQ方法相当的量化性能，证明了其在实际部署场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: Beacon在不需要手动调参和大型校准集的情况下，能通过几何构造自动确定每通道缩放因子，达到与现有最先进PTQ方法相当的性能，是一种实用且高效的模型部署方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

TL;DR: DALI infers latent contexts via self-supervised dynamics prediction within Dreamer


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: infer latent contexts for RL generalization

Method: analysis of methods

Result: improved zero-shot generalization and counterfactual consistency

Conclusion: DALI enables robust generalization without explicit context variables

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

*Fatema Siddika,Md Anwar Hossen,J. Pablo Muñoz,Tanya Roosta,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出联邦表示微调框架FedReFT，通过在客户端施加稀疏干预层直接调节隐藏表征，并引入All-But-Me(ABM)聚合策略缓解语义对齐被破坏的问题，在多个数据集和任务中相较现有PEFT方法有显著参数效率和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PEFT通过修改模型权重在联邦学习中受限于通信、设备异质性和语义对齐问题；ReFT通过操纵隐藏表征展现出更高效的微调潜力，但在FL中易受数据/模型异质性导致的聚合不匹配影响，需要新的聚合与个人化策略。

Method: 在每个客户端插入轻量稀疏干预层以直接调节隐藏表示；训练时采用ABM聚合——每个客户端接收除自身外其他客户端的聚合并以部分融合方式更新，从而平衡本地适应性与全局知识。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令微调和GLUE任务上，FedReFT优于现有PEFT方法，并在参数效率上比LoRA类方法高7-15倍，同时在异质性设置下表现稳健。

Conclusion: FedReFT在联邦学习场景下有效：稀疏表示干预+ABM聚合能在异质性环境中稳定训练并提升性能，相较LoRA类PEFT实现7x-15x的参数效率提升和总体更好性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

TL;DR: 本文从WHAT（任务语义）与HOW（协作结构）两角度构建双图表示，采用门控的Dual GCN自适应融合，从邮件数据实现更全面且可解释的内部人才推荐，Hit@100达40.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部推荐依赖少数管理者的视角，易遗漏合格候选人；论文旨在通过从企业邮件中自动挖掘员工的任务语义与合作关系，综合两类信息提升内部人才发现的全面性与公平性。

Method: 构建语义相似性图（WHAT）和交互/协作结构图（HOW），分别输入两个GCN分支进行编码，然后通过门控机制自适应学习两图表示的融合权重，最后用于候选员工排序与推荐。

Result: 在基准任务上，门控融合模型显著优于其他融合策略及启发式基线，Hit@100最高达40.9%。模型具有较高的可解释性，不同岗位族群（如销售/市场与研究类）显示不同的融合偏好（侧重HOW或均衡）。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种基于双图卷积网络（Dual GCN）并结合门控机制的自适应融合框架，用于从电子邮件数据中建模员工的职位适配性（WHAT与HOW两个维度），从而改进内部人才推荐。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布和任务训练专门模型，需大量已解实例采集训练数据，计算开销大且泛化性差；目标是构建通用的实例级MIP嵌入以提高可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出一个向量量化图自编码器（VQ-GAE），在未解的MIP实例上进行无监督预训练，产生离散代码分配作为实例表示；在下游任务中对这些嵌入进行微调以预测warm-start变量和cut-generation的整性差距。

Conclusion: Forge通过在大量异构MIP实例上进行无监督的向量量化图自编码器预训练，学得了一组离散代码（词汇表），能有效表示和聚类问题实例，并在下游监督任务中提升求解器性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在两面市场中精确度量地域层级的营销提升困难，SCM虽检验力高但常低估效应，且缺乏与panel-DML的系统比较。

Method: 构建一个开源模拟器，模拟N个区域市场在T_pre周前期和T_post周投放期的数据，设计五种应力测试（曲线基线、异质反应滞后、受处理影响的冲击、非线性链接函数、对照组漂移），比较7种估计器（3个ASC变体，4个panel-DML变体），每场景100次重复。

Result: 在含非线性或外生冲击的困难场景中，ASC显示严重偏差和接近零的覆盖率；panel-DML显著降低偏差，恢复名义上95%置信区间覆盖，表现更稳健。

Conclusion: ASC在常见复杂情境下偏差严重且置信区间失准，panel-DML更稳健且能恢复95%置信区间覆盖率。作者建议先诊断问题再选用合适的DML变体。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

TL;DR: 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 在对称矩阵分解上，作者通过解析Riccati类微分方程的闭式解，定量说明梯度流在小初始化下通过时间尺度分离实现按奇异值顺序增量学习，从而自然产生低秩近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解释为什么一阶优化算法（如梯度流）在过参数化模型、小初始化设置下会表现出隐式偏置，从而逐步学习目标矩阵的主成分，进而理解为什么训练会倾向于得到低秩解。

Method: 方法上，作者将对称矩阵分解的梯度流动力学转化为一个Riccati类的矩阵微分方程，并求得其闭式解；通过分析该解析解中的时间尺度和尺度参数（初始化规模）对不同分量的演化速度影响，证明了增量学习现象的出现与时间尺度分离的因果关系。

Result: 结果包括：1) 给出对称矩阵分解下梯度流的闭式解；2) 定量刻画了不同奇异值对应成分的学习速率和时间尺度分离；3) 证明随着初始化尺度减小，时间尺度分离增强，从而更明显地呈现增量学习并促进低秩近似；4) 讨论了将分析推广到非对称分解的可能方法与挑战。

Conclusion: 文章结论是：在对称矩阵分解问题中，梯度流在小初始化下产生的增量学习行为可以通过解析解（Riccati类矩阵微分方程的解）定量刻画；不同奇异值对应的学习动力学存在时间尺度分离，初始化越小分离越明显，从而有利于得到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucinations of LLMs when external knowledge is distributed across multiple sources and queries are ambiguous, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Probe DIF through gradient signals from annotated queries and Shapley value-based neuron attribution; train an alignment module with multi-prototype contrastive learning to model intra-source fine-grained structures and inter-source semantic alignment; construct knowledge partitions for retrieval.

Result: DFAMS probes dynamic information flow (DIF) in LLMs using gradient signals and Shapley value-based attribution to identify latent query intents and subdomain boundaries, then trains an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning to create semantically aligned knowledge partitions, improving retrieval and downstream QA.

Conclusion: DFAMS effectively leverages DIF to improve intent detection and cross-source semantic alignment, significantly enhancing knowledge classification, retrieval recall, and downstream QA accuracy in federated retrieval settings.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了ECG去噪精度，促进心脏数字孪生与实时监测的可靠性。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Motivation: Transformer的自注意力在序列长度上呈二次复杂度，限制了其在长序列任务中的应用；现有线性注意力方法往往通过核近似或限制上下文而牺牲性能，需提出既高效又保持性能的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息流拓扑结构的新线性注意力结构，通过重新配置神经元连接来实现线性复杂度且不使用数据无关的核近似或限制性上下文选择，确保计算精确注意力分数并保持完整历史上下文感知。

Result: 在一系列长序列推理任务中，TLinFormer在推理延迟、KV缓存效率、内存占用和整体速度方面对比标准Transformer表现出压倒性优势。

Conclusion: TLinFormer通过重构神经元连接模式，在严格线性复杂度下计算精确注意力分数并保持对全历史上下文的信息感知，从而在长序列推理任务中在延迟、KV缓存效率、内存占用和整体加速方面显著优于标准Transformer。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce geometric structure on decoder maps, enabling measurement of local deformations and curvature of learned manifolds

Method: Autoencoder with nonlinear conformal regularization

Result: Introduces conformal factor field, allows computation of scalar curvature; experiments on Swiss roll and CelebA demonstrate computation from network

Conclusion: 非线性共形正则化可作为控制和衡量自编码器解码器几何变形的工具，能导出局部尺度因子与曲率，拓展了自编码器在流形学习中的解释性与测量能力。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 用XAI+RDE比较ARIMA、GB、Chronos和Llama在金融、能源、交通、汽车销售四个领域的表现与可解释性：特征工程模型在波动/稀疏领域表现和可解释性优于基础模型；基础模型只在稳定/趋势明显的场景优胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TSFM越来越被用于现实决策，其表现不稳定和黑盒性质带来风险，需评估何时何地信任这些模型并提供可用的解释以指导用户交互和依赖模型输出。

Method: 比较四种模型（ARIMA、Gradient Boosting、Chronos、Llama）的预测性能与可解释性；使用传统XAI方法和Rating Driven Explanations来评估模型对四个领域数据集的解释质量；在不同领域和数据特性下对结果进行对比分析。

Result: They evaluate TSFM performance and interpretability using XAI and Rating Driven Explanations across ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, and Llama on four heterogeneous datasets; find feature-engineered models outperform foundation models in volatile/sparse domains and are more interpretable, while foundation models do better in stable/trend-driven contexts.

Conclusion: 特征工程和基于树的模型在含噪、稀疏或高波动时更稳健且更可解释；时间序列专用或通用大型基础模型在稳定、趋势主导的数据上表现出色，但在复杂实务场景中可能逊色且可解释性较差。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: 本文研究对角化状态空间模型(SSM)的初始化方法，从频域视角分析参数化与学习偏差，并提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化S4D-DFouT，通过极点放置启发扩展规模，在长序列基准上取得SOTA并能在大数据集上从头训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于HiPPO的SSM初始化虽效果好但计算复杂度高，部分对角化替代方法更高效却缺乏系统性频域分析，作者旨在理解对角初始化的本质偏差并设计更优的初始化策略以兼顾性能与效率。

Method: 从频率域出发，分析对角SSM的参数化和学习偏差，提出在离散傅里叶域初始化对角态空间的S4D-DFouT方案，并结合极点放置策略优化学习与稳定性，随后在LRA基准和PathX-256上进行训练与比较。

Result: S4D-DFouT在长序列基准Long Range Arena取得SOTA，并支持从头在大型数据集PathX-256上训练，表明所提频域对角初始化在性能与可扩展性上优于现有对角方法。

Conclusion: 通过在离散傅里叶域进行对角化初始化并合理放置极点，S4D-DFouT在效率与性能间取得平衡，显著提升长序列建模能力，能扩大模型规模并在LRA等基准和PathX-256大数据集上实现优异表现。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC利用嵌入相似度对待忘样本分配不同遗忘力度，并用ICL生成的代理测试数据软约束以防止过度遗忘，作为可插拔模块改善梯度基方法，在TOFU和MUSE上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM训练数据包含私人或版权内容，需在不重训情况下移除特定数据的影响

Method: 1) 计算待忘与保留样本在嵌入空间的相似度，用以重加权样本损失（纠缠感知）；2) 用ICL生成的代理测试数据构造软约束，防止过度遗忘；3) 将两者与现有梯度基目标结合，作为可插拔优化器组件进行微调（与NPO+GD结合取得最好效果）

Result: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，通过样本纠缠感知的损失重加权和基于ICL生成数据的代理约束，提升遗忘-效用权衡，结合NPO+GD接近全量重训性能

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC能更精细地控制遗忘边界，减少残留泄漏与过度遗忘，兼容现有目标函数并可拓展到多模型，接近重训效果

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Conclusion: 当前差分隐私文本生成方法在严格隐私预算下难以保持与真实数据接近的效用和保真度，需发展更先进的隐私保护共享方法并在更现实场景下评估。

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的方法只建模编码间的二元关系且采用局部消息传递，无法捕捉临床数据中的高阶依赖和全局交互，限制了表示能力与预测性能。

Method: 构建病历中医疗编码的超图（节点为编码，超边为同诊疗序列或访视），用超图结构编码器提取高阶交互特征；将这些表示输入改造的Transformer以实现全局注意力/推理；同时加入超图重构损失以保持超图原始结构信息。

Result: 在真实EHR数据集上进行诊断预测任务，SHGT在多个评测指标上超越了当前最先进模型，证明高阶建模与结构保持有助于提升性能。

Conclusion: SHGT通过超图结构编码、Transformer推理和重构损失，更好地捕捉EHR中医学编码的高阶关系，从而提升诊断预测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR2 builds a self-improving loop: generator creates medical data, reward model selects/improves it, enabling superior SFT and RL; yields strong cross-modal generalization and data efficiency


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of expert-annotated medical VLM data and unreliable rewards for RL

Method: Generative Reward Learning co-develops data generator and reward model

Result: SFT on generated data surpasses human-curated baselines; RL (GRPO) achieves SOTA cross-modality/task generalization; compact model matches much larger foundation models

Conclusion: MedGR2 reframes scarcity as generation, unlocking robust RL and high performance with smaller models

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Motivation: 传统仅使用单一指标（如准确率或召回率）进行超参调优会导致模型在其他重要方面（排序、推荐多样性、计算资源）表现欠佳，故需一种能兼顾多维性能的通用优化工具。

Method: 构建一个统一的多目标综合指标（可能采用加权或标度变换等方法）作为优化目标，并在超参数搜索过程中以该综合准则替代单一指标，结合常见的搜索策略（网格搜索、随机搜索或贝叶斯优化等）进行超参调整。

Result: 提出的方法可在实验中实现更均衡的性能表现，提高整体推荐质量并降低资源开销，且该工具具有通用性，可推广到其他机器学习和数据分析任务中进行多目标超参优化。

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT通过max-norm和元素级trust ratio更有效地控制注意力最大logit，提升大批量训练稳定性，使语言模型可在更大批量下训练而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大批量训练中，注意力层的最大attention logit急剧上升，导致信息瓶颈并使AdamW等优化器出现性能退化，LAMB的L2范数信任比对控制最大值效果有限且忽视行/列内权重关系，需更直接和细粒度的缩放策略。

Method: 提出使用max-norm代替LAMB中的L2范数来计算trust ratio以直接约束query/key权重的最大值，并进一步设计元素级的trust ratios以基于局部权重结构进行更精细的更新缩放。实验在不同规模的GPT-2上进行对比验证。

Result: 在多种规模的GPT-2大批量训练中，MERIT表现优于现有方法。特别是GPT-2 Medium在使用MERIT时可将批量增至6k而保持与标准批量（480）相当的性能，在48B训练token下无性能下降。

Conclusion: MERIT通过基于max-norm的trust ratio和元素级（element-wise）比例缩放，有效抑制注意力层中最大attention logit的急剧增大，从而改善大批量训练下语言模型的优化与泛化，显著提升稳定性并允许更大批量（如GPT-2 Medium批量6k）训练而不降性能。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机超参数学习方法（偏置随机梯度或诱导点变分推断）在资源受限条件下无法保证收敛到真实边缘似然的驻点，需提出能在有限内存和小批量下仍保证收敛或更好表现的新方法。

Method: 对诱导低维RKHS的核，直接在参数空间或RKHS表示上进行无偏的随机梯度估计；对无限维RKHS使用近似截断或随机特征映射以换取可计算性，结合相应的优化算法保证在资源受限下更好的性能。

Result: This paper proposes exact stochastic inference algorithms for Gaussian Processes with kernels inducing finite-dimensional RKHS, and extensions to infinite-dimensional RKHSs with approximate exactness, aiming to guarantee convergence to stationary points of true marginal likelihood under memory-limited batch sizes.

Conclusion: 方法在有限维RKHS情况下实现了对真实边缘似然的精确随机推断并保证收敛；在无限维时以近似方式应用，整体在小批量或少诱导点的资源受限场景中表现更好。

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于节点中心性插入共享可训练嵌入的局部虚拟节点（LVN）方法，有针对性地缓解over-squashing，同时保持原图全局结构，实验证明能提升GNN任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过重连图或添加虚拟节点的方法虽然能缓解信息瓶颈，但会改变原始图的全局拓扑，可能破坏领域知识。提出LVN旨在在不显著破坏原图结构的前提下，针对可能发生over-squashing的局部区域改进信息流动。

Method: 基于节点中心性选择潜在瓶颈区域，在这些区域插入局部虚拟节点（LVN）并为其分配可训练且在选定区域共享的嵌入，通过这些LVN在远距离节点间建立额外通信路径而无需增加网络层数或显著重连图。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上的实验显示，LVN能有效增强局部结构连通性，在图分类和节点分类任务上带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: LVN通过在高中心性节点附近添加带有可训练共享嵌入的局部虚拟节点，缓解了图神经网络中的over-squashing问题，同时尽量保持原图全局结构不被破坏。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 面向任务的可信度评估：引入模型相关距离并给出维度无关样本复杂度的回归可信度验证算法，理论与数值结果支持其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维分布距离估计通常样本复杂度随维度指数增长，但在特定分析模型下，不同分布可能产生一致的结论，因而有必要设计任务/模型相关的方法评估样本调查的可信性以降低样本需求。

Method: 定义模型特定的距离度量并设计了一个专注于验证调查数据可信性的算法，该算法通过核查模型输出或预测行为而非重建完整回归模型来判断样本是否可信，从而避免维度诅咒。还证明了若通过重建回归模型来验证，则样本复杂度会随维度线性增长。

Conclusion: 论文提出了面向任务的采样可信度评估方法，通过构建模型相关的距离度量来衡量样本调查数据对回归分析的可信性，并设计了一个在回归模型背景下验证调查数据可信性的算法。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Result: 提出GDS agent：在MCP服务器中集成全面图算法工具、预处理与后处理模块，可与任意现代LLM配合，能对需图算法推理的问题给出准确有据的回答；并引入新基准评估中间工具调用与最终响应，展示对多种图任务的解决能力，提供案例研究和未来方向

Conclusion: GDS agent显著提升了LLM在图数据推理的能力，但仍存在挑战，论文给出案例、失败场景及未来工作路线

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出在可逆矩阵空间用近端梯度类随机算法联合学习预测模型的多试验监督ICA，利用任务监督改善非凸优化与成分可解释性，在合成与真实数据上验证了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多科学场景中（如神经信号、多次试验的行为记录），数据包含多次试验并伴有任务相关标签或外部变量，传统ICA仅利用统计独立性，易受初始化和非凸性影响，且提取的成分与任务无关。引入多试验监督信息可以提高分离成功率并使成分更具有解释性。

Method: 方法是在可逆矩阵（分离矩阵）上执行近端梯度类随机优化，算法同时训练一个用于多试验预测的模型（例如神经网络），通过反向传播将任务损失反馈到分离矩阵，形成联合目标。该方法利用多次试验间的标签或行为信息作为监督，来引导ICA的盲分离过程，并在每次迭代中混合无监督独立性目标和有监督预测损失；实现上采用可逆矩阵参数化、梯度裁剪或正则化项以保持解的可逆性和稳定性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据实验中，带监督的ICA较传统盲ICA显著提高了非凸优化的成功率，提取的独立成分与任务变量相关性更高且更易解释；定量指标（如恢复误差、预测精度）和定性结果均显示优势。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合多次试验监督信息的随机独立成分分析（ICA）算法，通过在可逆矩阵空间中使用近端梯度类方法并联合通过反向传播学习预测模型，有效利用监督信号改善非凸优化的收敛性和分离结果的可解释性。

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

TL;DR: 将潜在扩散生成作为自监督目标，通过编码器条件化生成，EEGDM学习到更丰富的EEG语义表征，在有限数据下仍能实现高质量重建与竞争性下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG表示学习（如EEGPT、LaBraM）多依赖简单的掩码重建，难以捕捉EEG信号的复杂语义和时空模式，且在数据有限时泛化能力不足，因而需要更强的生成式自监督目标来提高表征质量。

Method: 提出将潜在扩散模型用于EEG自监督表示学习：引入一个EEG编码器将原始信号及其通道增强编码为紧凑潜在向量，作为扩散模型的条件信息，驱动信号生成；训练目标为信号生成/重建而非简单的掩码重建。

Result: 实验证明EEGDM可以重建高质量EEG信号，学到鲁棒表征，并在多个下游任务上在预训练数据量适中情况下取得竞争性结果，显示出良好的泛化性和实用价值。

Conclusion: EEGDM通过将潜在扩散模型作为自监督目标，能够学习到更具语义信息的紧凑EEG表征，从而在有限预训练数据下仍能在多种下游任务中取得竞争性表现。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE with ViT can be adapted to 1D ultrasound; pre-training on synthetic unlabeled data yields robust features that outperform scratch-trained models and CNNs and transfer better to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apply MAE+ViT self-supervised learning to 1D ultrasound signals where labeled data scarce; improve representations for downstream tasks like ToF classification.

Method: Adapt MAE+ViT to 1D signals: segment into patches, apply high masking ratio, pre-train on synthetic unlabeled ultrasound, fine-tune on downstream tasks (e.g., ToF classification); evaluate impact of model size, patch size, masking ratio, and compare to CNN baselines and scratch-trained ViTs.

Result: Pre-trained MAE models on synthetic ultrasound improve downstream accuracy vs. training from scratch and CNN baselines; model size, patch size, masking ratio affect performance; synthetic pre-training transfers well to real signals.

Conclusion: MAE pre-training on synthetic ultrasound signals is effective for 1D ultrasound analysis, improving downstream task performance and transferability to real measurements; optimizing model/patch/mask hyperparameters is important.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Motivation: 随着具备检索、记忆或外部API的工具增强型语言模型快速发展，作者希望从理论上解释和证明这些工具带来的实际好处，尤其是在事实回忆和扩展性方面。

Method: 理论上通过信息论/电路构造证明：展示一个简单而高效的电路，利用外部检索实现无界事实回忆，同时证明仅在权重中记忆的事实数量受参数数目上界限制。实证上在受控实验中比较工具使用模型与记忆模型的性能，并在预训练模型上对比教工具使用与微调事实的效果。

Result: 理论证明：权重记忆受参数数量限制，而工具使用可实现无界事实回忆；实验证实工具使用模型在回忆任务中优于记忆模型；对预训练模型的实验显示训练工具使用和普适规则比微调事实更有效。

Conclusion: 工具使用（外部检索）在事实回忆上在理论上和实证上都优于仅靠模型权重的记忆；工具化工作流在扩展性上有可证明的优势。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Motivation: 需要一种高效且可控的机器遗忘方法，用于在扩散模型中删除对特定类别的生成能力，以满足隐私或合规需求，同时尽量保留模型的其他能力。

Method: 基于信息论，通过在去噪过程的早期步骤选择性地增加噪声熵，使得针对不可接受类别的条件生成退化为高斯噪声，从而实现机器遗忘。

Result: 实验显示SAFEMax在忘记目标类别上效果显著，并在计算效率上相较于现有最先进方法有明显提升。

Conclusion: SAFEMax通过在生成图像时最大化熵并在不允许的类别上停止去噪，能够有效去除扩散模型对这些类别的记忆，同时保留其他知识。

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的一步扩散蒸馏依赖通过DSM学习的评分函数来近似训练目标的梯度，但DSM不可避免存在估计偏差，导致蒸馏效果受限。需要一种能提供无偏梯度估计、直接用于蒸馏的新目标。

Method: 构建一个变分可微上界（Variational Diffusive Upper Bound），推导出可得无偏梯度估计的目标函数，并将其直接用于一步扩散蒸馏的学生模型训练，避免依赖不完美的DSM评分函数。

Result: 在与Diff-Instruct的对比实验中，VarDiU在生成质量上优于对手，同时训练更高效更稳定。

Conclusion: VarDiU通过引入变分扩散上界，解决了DSM带来的梯度偏差问题，在一阶段扩散蒸馏中比Diff-Instruct表现更好，实现更高的样本质量和更稳健高效的训练。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Motivation: 受数值PDE迭代方法启发，希望在不增加参数或架构复杂度显著增长的情况下，增强神经算子的表达能力与解算复杂PDE问题的能力，同时降低训练与推理的计算成本。

Method: 设计单一神经算子块并反复迭代应用形成深层算子（self-composition），引入自适应的train-and-unroll训练阶段：从浅层开始训练，逐步增加复合次数；对高频USCT使用多重网格（multigrid）启发的骨干以更好处理尺度和波动。理论上给出误差随深度下降的保证与训练复杂度分析。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

TL;DR: DiTree uses diffusion policy action samplers within sampling-based planners to guide kinodynamic planning; it generalizes provably and improves speed and success rate compared to classical SBPs and standalone DPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kinodynamic motion planning needs collision-free trajectories with dynamic constraints; existing SBPs are slow due to uninformed action sampling; learning-based approaches are faster but lack generalization and guarantees.

Method: Use diffusion policies conditioned on local observations as informed action samplers inside sampling-based planners (e.g., RRT). The framework preserves SBP completeness and safety guarantees while leveraging learned samplers trained on expert trajectories to guide action propagation efficiently.

Result: DiTree, a framework combining diffusion policies with SBPs (e.g., RRT) to provide provably-safe, generalizable informed sampling, trained on a single environment; achieves ~3x faster than classical SBPs and ~30% higher success rate in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion policies with SBPs yields a provably-generalizable, safe planning method that accelerates exploration and improves success in out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrated with RRT+DP trained on one environment.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alleviate data sparsity and improve understanding by uncovering latent sequential physiological states to synthesize realistic clinical time series

Method: Unsupervised compositional modeling of clinical time series

Result: Compositionally synthesized data yields comparable forecasting performance to original data, better than random augmentation; training solely on synthetic data improves SOFA prediction

Conclusion: 基于学习到的状态与组合规则合成的临床时序数据能保留关键分布特征，支持有效训练与评估模型，缓解低资源问题并提升某些任务表现。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Conclusion: RLG为扩散模型提供了一种理论上有根据且实用的推理时对齐控制方法，能在保持生成质量的同时灵活调整与下游目标的对齐强度，适用于多种任务与设置。

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG

Result: 跨多模型与多种RL算法的广泛实验表明TokenBuncher在防止RL-based有害微调方面鲁棒，同时保留模型在良性任务上的性能与可微调性。

Conclusion: RL比SFT在有害微调方面构成更大风险，TokenBuncher通过限制响应不确定性可有效防御RL有害微调，在保持模型良性效用的同时阻止能力升级。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Motivation: 现有cMARL依赖噪声代理估计信号进行课程构建，导致在复杂多智能体环境中表现差，需更可靠的语义化课程与多样性机制以防模式崩溃

Method: 使用LLM生成情境与评价信号，结合多样性驱动的情境混合构建新训练情境；训练上下文不可知策略

Result: cMALC-D uses LLMs to create curricula and BLEnded contexts to improve MARL generalization

Conclusion: cMALC-D在交通信号控制实验中提升了泛化能力和样本效率，优于现有课程学习基线

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Motivation: Reduce computational cost and parameters of sequential encoder-decoder methods for continuous embedding optimization in automated feature transformation

Method: Transformer-based automated feature transformation with revised GPT

Result: Framework achieves comparable or better performance than baselines and improves computational efficiency

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的多目标优化框架能在减少参数和加速转换过程中保持甚至提升下游任务性能，展示了可扩展自动特征转换的潜力

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD能更好地捕捉多步欺诈模式和账户特有的短时异常活动，在四个真实数据集上表现优于七个基线。

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj通过整合和标准化多个大型DFT轨迹数据源，提供了一个包含超过1.2亿原子构型的高质量数据集，显著简化了训练可迁移、准确的机器学习原子势的流程。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2T-FM repurposes a tabular foundation model (TabPFNv2) for graphs by augmenting node features with neighborhood aggregation and structural embeddings, yielding competitive or superior performance to existing GFMs and GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design graph foundation models that can handle diverse node features across datasets by leveraging tabular foundation models' success.

Method: Augment node features with neighborhood aggregation, add structural embeddings, then apply TabPFNv2 to node representations; evaluate in-context and after finetuning against GFMs and GNNs.

Result: Proposed G2T-FM uses TabPFNv2 backbone with neighborhood aggregation and structural embeddings, achieving strong in-context performance and surpassing GFMs and GNNs after finetuning.

Conclusion: Using tabular foundation models for graph tasks is promising; G2T-FM shows that TabPFNv2-based approach achieves strong in-context and finetuned results, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

TL;DR: Introduces first combinatorial bandit model with nonstationary agent rewards capturing habituation/recovery; provides algorithms with theoretical dynamic regret and strong empirical gains in a diabetes intervention


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sequential subset selection when agent responses change over time due to habituation or recovery, and individual effects are unknown

Method: Combinatorial nonstationary CMAB with habituation/recovery

Result: Algorithms with dynamic regret guarantees; case study shows up to 3x enrollment improvement

Conclusion: Framework effectively handles nonstationary intervention effects, balancing heterogeneous rewards and exploration; demonstrates significant real-world impact in community interventions

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve In-Context Learning by selecting exemplars that are both relevant and diverse using Submodular Mutual Information (SMI).

Method: Paper analysis

Result: Introduced InSQuAD: SMI-based unified selection strategy, combinatorial training with likelihood-based loss, synthetic paraphrase augmentation, and improved performance on nine benchmarks.

Conclusion: SMI-driven targeted selection and combinatorial training improve retrieval for ICL, validated across multiple QA benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

TL;DR: 将SNGD/SPRING在线性+强凸二次损失下等价化为（加速）正则化Kaczmarz方法，借助已有随机线代分析首次给出SNGD/SPRING的快速收敛保证并证明加速性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中的表现优异但缺乏理论解释；通过将其与已知随机迭代方法（Kaczmarz）建立联系，可用成熟的随机线性代数工具来解释和证明其收敛性与加速效果，从而填补理论空白并指导实践。

Method: 在理想化线性模型与强凸二次损失假设下，将SNGD/SPRING的迭代映射转化为随机（正则化）Kaczmarz迭代，利用现有的随机线性代数收敛分析（包括加速Kaczmarz的结果）导出收敛率；对于一般二次损失，扩展了Kaczmarz分析以处理曲率结构的影响，得到在更强条件下的快速收敛率。

Result: 论文表明：在参数化线性、强凸二次损失的理想化问题下，子采样自然梯度下降（SNGD）与其加速变体SPRING可等价于（加速）正则化Kaczmarz方法，从而通过随机线性代数工具为SNGD提供了收敛性理论解释。具体结论包括：SNGD在最小二乘问题上等价于带正则的Kaczmarz方法，SPRING等价于其加速版本；由此得到SNGD的首个快速收敛率、SPRING的首个收敛性保证以及SPRING加速SNGD的首次证明。在一般强凸二次损失下，扩展Kaczmarz分析可在更强条件下给出SNGD的快速收敛率，解释SNGD在非最小二乘场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文建立了SNGD与Kaczmarz方法的等价关系，并利用该关系证明了SNGD的快速收敛、为SPRING给出首次收敛性保证和加速证据，同时在更一般的强凸二次情形下扩展了理论，解释了SNGD在更多问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Method: 在商品硬件上运行小型语言模型，设计多种政治人格模板，自动化生成和回复社交媒体式信息，使用自动指标（如风格相似度、意识形态偏向、极端性度量）评估输出，无需人工标注；比较不同模型与人格组合，并在需要反驳的交互情境下测量行为变化。

Result: The paper demonstrates that small LMs can generate coherent, persona-driven political messages; persona design influences output more than model identity; engagement that demands counter-argument strengthens ideological adherence and increases extreme content; and fully automated influence campaigns are feasible for diverse actors, suggesting defense should focus on detection/disruption of campaigns rather than access restriction. It also notes consistent persona-driven outputs provide detection signatures.

Conclusion: 小模型足以进行端到端自动化影响行动，且通过个性设计可保持一致性；防御策略应优先开发基于对话的检测与干预工具，利用人格一致性作为识别信号。

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to
its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks
targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware
across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to
extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep
learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of
labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient
malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage
the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for
malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we
translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This
allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another
ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware
detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.

Motivation: 现有水印方法如SynthID-Text在应对保持语义的攻击（改写、回译、局部编辑）时检测率显著下降，需要一种更鲁棒的方法能在保留原意的同时保持水印可检出性。

Method: 提出混合框架SynGuard，将语义信息检索(SIR)与SynthID-Text的概率水印机制结合：在词汇层面嵌入概率水印，同时利用SIR进行语义层面的对齐与签名，以保持文本含义并增强恢复能力；在训练/推理阶段联合优化两个层面的嵌入和检测。

Result: 在多种攻击场景下对比实验表明，SynGuard在水印恢复上比SynthID-Text平均提升11.1% F1；展示在不同攻击类型（改写、回译、复制粘贴）下的稳定性，并公开了代码与数据集。

Conclusion: SynGuard通过在词汇和语义两个层面联合嵌入水印，有效提高了对保持语义的攻击（如改写、复制粘贴、回译）的鲁棒性，较SynthID-Text平均提升11.1%的F1得分，证明语义感知水印在抵抗真实篡改方面有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and

Result: Proposed GSL-based framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node representations to resist adversarial network model manipulation; demonstrated superior robustness in case study on security dataset compared to representative methods

Conclusion: GSL can enhance resilience and reliability of IoE networks against evolving attacks; further research needed on scalability, real-time learning, interpretability, and integration with domain-specific controls

Abstract: The Internet of Energy (IoE) integrates IoT-driven digital communication with
power grids to enable efficient and sustainable energy systems. Still, its
interconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber
threats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional
safeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety
consequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level
safeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based
safeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node
representations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently.
Through a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a
security dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative
methods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against
evolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the
resilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing
critical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose
future research directions in this novel research area.

*Hyejun Jeong,Mohammadreze Teymoorianfard,Abhinav Kumar,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Badasarian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Passive network observers can infer WRA prompts and user traits from visited IP/timing metadata; attack recovers substantial prompt content and traits; simple mitigations reduce but don't eliminate leakage


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Show that locally-deployed language-model-based web agents (WRAs) can leak prompts and user traits via passive network observers due to rich, correlated domain access patterns

Method: Network metadata inference attack on Web and Research Agents

Result: Built WRA trace dataset; defined OBELS metric; attack recovers >73% functional and domain prompt info; recovers up to 19/32 latent traits; attack robust to noise/partial views; mitigations reduce attack efficacy by ~29% with little utility loss

Conclusion: WRAs, even when run locally, are vulnerable to metadata inference attacks; defenses that limit domain diversity or obfuscate traces can partially mitigate risks without major utility loss

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

Motivation: AI引入了专用基础设施、大规模数据存储和先进硬件，同时改变了攻击者的目标，从传统权限与横向移动转向操纵AI输出以实现系统级影响。

Method: 通过梳理AI生命周期各环节的攻防面、分析实际被利用案例、并结合供应链与运维场景提出安全关注点与防护建议。

Conclusion: 该论文表明在将AI纳入软件系统后，出现了新的网络安全威胁，传统安全评估不足以覆盖这些风险。

Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling
powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data
storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique
attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments
often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional
goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs
to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding
outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to
raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the
AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights
from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can
better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Junyang Zhang,Guanquan Shi,HaoRan Cheng,Yunhao Yao,Kaiwen Guo,Haohua Du,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出MindGuard，应对通过篡改工具元数据进行的工具投毒攻击（TPA）。通过构建基于注意力机制的决策依赖图（DDG），在决策层跟踪调用溯源，实现检测与归因。实验表明在检测与归因上效果优异，且开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP规范化了LLM与工具的交互，但引入了通过污染工具元数据诱导未经授权操作的风险。现有行为级防御因不需执行被污染工具而难以检测此类攻击，因而需要决策层的溯源与防护机制。

Method: 基于对LLM注意力与调用决策关联的实证发现，设计Decision Dependence Graph（DDG），将模型推理表示为带权定向图。通过鲁棒的DDG构建流程与图异常检测算法，检测并归因被污染的工具元数据。

Result: 在真实数据集上，MindGuard在检测被污染调用上达94%-99%平均精确率，归因准确率95%-100%，处理时间低于1秒且不增加token成本。

Conclusion: MindGuard能在决策层有效检测并归因工具投毒攻击，具备高精度与低延迟，并为将传统安全策略应用于LLM决策层提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the
interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend
introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is
poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing
defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally
ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no
behavioral trace to monitor.
  Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents,
providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and
poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision
remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation
between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we
choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize
this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning
process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts
and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust
DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently
detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting
poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times
under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as
an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a
solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision
level.

TL;DR: 本文综述了联邦学习（FL）在医学影像全流程中的应用，重点覆盖上游重建任务与下游诊断/分割任务，讨论了如何在多机构异构数据上进行协同训练以保护隐私，并分析了提高通信效率、数据异质性对齐与安全聚合等关键技术，最后展望未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限于患者隐私与法规限制，医学影像数据难以集中共享，阻碍大规模模型训练与持续更新；联邦学习作为隐私保护的分布式训练框架，可在多机构间协同构建高性能模型，因而成为推动医学影像AI发展的重要方向。

Method: 本文通过文献综述的方式，按影像分析全流程将相关工作分类为上游（如CT/MRI重建）与下游（如肿瘤诊断、分割）两大类，逐项总结FL的具体实现（如物理驱动重建网络、联邦微调）、技术改进（通信压缩、异构对齐、加密/安全聚合）并比较其优缺点。

Result: 综述汇总了FL在医学影像上游重建与下游临床任务的主要成果、方法与改进策略，指出现有方法在提高鲁棒性、通信效率与隐私保护方面取得进展，但在处理数据异构性、模型可解释性与法规合规性方面仍有待突破。

Conclusion: FL为医学影像领域提供了在保护患者隐私前提下构建与持续更新大型AI模型的可行路径，能在重建与临床诊断任务中缓解数据分散与隐私限制，但仍需解决通信成本、数据异构性、模型泛化与安全性等挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: approximate caching in diffusion-model serving enables remote covert channels, prompt theft, and poisoning leading to content leakage and injection


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: assess security risks from approximate caching in diffusion models

Method: analysis of attacks

Result: covert channel, prompt stealing, poisoning attacks demonstrated remotely

Conclusion: approximate caching breaks multi-user isolation and requires defenses like stricter cache policies, access controls, sanitization, rate limits

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce
content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally
intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted
approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a
cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by
breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new
security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we
demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender
injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover
that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt
stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached
prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack
that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render
them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed
remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security
vulnerabilities in approximate caching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，攻击者可利用自动化推理与代码合成能力降低实施高复杂度恶意活动的门槛，产生更难检测和适应性强的威胁；研究旨在提前识别并量化这类风险，以推动防御与政策应对。

Method: 构建了一个研究原型，将自然语言提示嵌入二进制，运行时调用开源LLM进行代码合成与决策；采用阶段中心化方法（侦察、载荷生成、传播、执行、勒索）对不同环境进行定量与定性评估，并通过案例研究展示多层遥测数据与行为信号。

Result: 在多个测试环境中，开源LLM成功生成可执行的勒索组件并完成闭环攻击流程；评估显示攻击在保密性、适应性与针对性上有显著提升，并识别了若干可供检测的行为信号与遥测特征。

Conclusion: 证明了LLM可被滥用来实现自治且自适应的勒索软件，传统基于签名的检测难以应对，需要开发基于行为的检测、运行时遥测与策略管控来缓解此类AI驱动威胁。

Abstract: Using automated reasoning, code synthesis, and contextual decision-making, we
introduce a new threat that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle.
Ransomware 3.0 represents the first threat model and research prototype of
LLM-orchestrated ransomware. Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only
requires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is
synthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants
that adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance,
payload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack
campaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal,
enterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that
measures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase.
We show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and
sustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments. Finally, we present
behavioral signals and multi-level telemetry of Ransomware 3.0 through a case
study to motivate future development of better defenses and policy enforcements
to address novel AI-enabled ransomware attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods focus on single-chain behaviors and cannot capture cross-chain semantics, leaving gaps in identifying cross-chain bridge attacks.

Method: Heterogeneous graph attention network modeling cross-chain semantics

Result: BridgeShield models source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain in a unified heterogeneous graph; uses intra-meta-path and inter-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies and highlight discriminative patterns; achieves average F1 92.58%, 24.39% improvement over baselines on 51 real-world attacks.

Conclusion: BridgeShield有效提升了跨链桥攻击检测性能，为多链生态安全提供可行方案。

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

Motivation: 解决地球与火星间高延迟、间歇连接对区块链时间证明、交易结算与审计带来的挑战，确保跨行星货币体系的可靠性、不可篡改性与责任追溯。

Method: 提出PoTT原语并形式化其安全模型；结合DTN与LEO星座进行系统设计，采用头部优先复制、行星级长时程闪电通道与守望塔、以及基于联邦侧链或盲合并挖矿的结算机制；通过安全分析与可测改进评估其对可靠性与可审计性的提升。

Result: 形式化PoTT并分析安全性；设计了结合DTN与LEO的架构，提出多种结算路径（联邦侧链或BMM提交链），短期部署建议强联邦，长期可选BMM；证明在不改动比特币共识与货币基数下提升了可靠性与可审计性。

Conclusion: PoTT可为星际环境提供可审计的比特币时间戳和传输证明，提升跨行星结算的可靠性与问责性，同时保留地球L1货币基数不变；短期优先强联邦，本地结算，长期考虑盲合并挖矿提交链。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of deploying Bitcoin as the shared monetary
standard between Earth and Mars, accounting for physical constraints of
interplanetary communication. We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit
Timestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for
Bitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging
Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO)
mesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication,
long-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure
settlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit
chains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it
measurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin
consensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations
for local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted)
provide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while
Mars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged
assets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon
regimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to
administrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring.

Motivation: 研究者在网络安全中主要使用LLM进行红队操作，而防御性应用（事件响应与取证）研究较少。本文旨在系统性地研究用于真实网络应用攻击取证的LLM-agent设计，以填补防御方向的研究空白。

Method: 设计并实现CyberSleuth代理，集成分组级流量与应用日志分析工具；比较四种代理架构与六个LLM后端，在30个事件场景（20训练/benchmark + 10来自2025的独立测试）上评估准确率与报告质量；进行22人专家的人类评估。

Conclusion: CyberSleuth在设计与模型选择上展现高性能，能在多种复杂事件中准确识别漏洞并生成有价值报告；释放数据与平台有助于推动防御向的LLM研究和可重复评估。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powerful tools for automating complex
tasks. In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in
red-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests.
Defensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively
less attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic
study of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web
application attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes
packet-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the
exploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences
of core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture -
and provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent
architectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing
complexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a
separate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the
exact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts,
which rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They
also expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source
LLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our
benchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible
evaluation of forensic agents.

Motivation: 解决AI生成代码中高比例漏洞导致的安全审计扩展性危机，通过自动化工具提升审计能力和效率。

Method: 设计多智能体系统以LLM为指挥协调，集成工具驱动执行（如扫描、请求构造与回放、漏洞利用），并进行端到端利用验证与成本跟踪与早停策略。

Result: 在XBOW基准104项挑战中实现76.9%总体成功率，对SSRF和配置错误达到完美，对Broken Authorization 83%，对各种注入攻击表现良好；成本低廉且在真实开源项目中发现多个严重漏洞，已进行漏洞披露与CVE申请。

Conclusion: MAPTA显著提高了Web应用安全审计的自动化和可扩展性，成本可控且实战有效，但对XSS和盲注等仍有挑战，可通过改进策略与资源配置进一步提升。

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a
broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis
in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code
contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the
capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application
security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with
tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average
operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical
vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and
arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10
findings are under CVE review.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出JADES框架，通过将有害问题自动分解为加权子问题、逐一评分并聚合，以更精细地判断越狱是否成功；在新构建的JailbreakQR数据集上与人工标注的二分类一致率达98.5%，显著优于基线，并揭示了现有攻击效果的高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱评估常依赖不对齐的代理指标或整体化主观判断，易误判且与人类感知不一致，急需一种更精细、可解释且与人类判定一致的评估机制。

Method: 提出一种自动分解有害输入为加权子问题的方法，对每个子问题的模型回答进行评分并按权重汇总为最终判断；可选加入事实核查模块以检测模型回答中的虚构信息。

Result: 在作者新建的JailbreakQR基准（400对人工注释的提示-响应）上，JADES在二分类任务中与人工判定一致率为98.5%，比强基线高9%以上；对五种流行攻击在四个LLM的重评显示之前的攻击成功率被普遍高估。

Conclusion: JADES能提供准确、一致且具可解释性的越狱检测评估，优于传统方法，并能纠正对攻击成功率的高估，是衡量未来越狱攻击的可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising
three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations
-- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design
adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an
LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with
domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit
peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial
prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial
LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show
that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that
adversely affect a "honest-but-lazy" reviewer. Finally, we propose and
empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under
automated content checks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态分析可扩展性差、误报/漏报高，且AI方法受限于训练数据质量与数量，需自动生成真实、类别特定的漏洞数据集以提升AI检测与修复能力。

Method: 协调多个模拟专家推理的AI代理、函数代理和传统代码分析工具；使用RAG进行上下文检索和Low-Rank近似权重进行高效微调；在三基准上评估116个样本。

Result: Automatically generate realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++ codebases using coordinated AI agents, function agents, and code analysis tools; use Retrieval-Augmented Generation and low-rank weight approximation for efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该方法能在函数级别高成功率地注入漏洞，生成可用于训练AI检测/修复模型的数据集；结合RAG和低秩微调提高效率与语境相关性，优于其他技术。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

TL;DR: 提出更全面的PI基准并设计PromptSleuth，通过任务层语义推理检测注入意图，在多基准上优于现有防御，效率可比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the evolving threat of Prompt Injection (PI) attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), noting that existing benchmarks are insufficient due to paraphrasing, obfuscation, and multi-task injections by attackers.

Method: 构建扩展性基准（包含新操控技巧与多任务场景），并设计PromptSleuth：基于任务意图推理的检测框架，通过语义层面判断输入意图来识别恶意注入，实验对比展示其优越性与效率。

Result: They build a comprehensive benchmark that subsumes prior benchmarks and introduces new attack techniques and multi-task scenarios; they propose PromptSleuth, an intent-based semantic defense framework, which outperforms existing defenses while keeping runtime and cost comparable.

Conclusion: Intent-based semantic reasoning is a robust, efficient, and generalizable defense against evolving prompt injection attacks; existing defenses have weaknesses under the new benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, from virtual assistants to autonomous agents. However, their
flexibility also introduces new attack vectors-particularly Prompt Injection
(PI), where adversaries manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs. As
attackers continuously evolve with paraphrased, obfuscated, and even multi-task
injection strategies, existing benchmarks are no longer sufficient to capture
the full spectrum of emerging threats.
  To address this gap, we construct a new benchmark that systematically extends
prior efforts. Our benchmark subsumes the two widely-used existing ones while
introducing new manipulation techniques and multi-task scenarios, thereby
providing a more comprehensive evaluation setting. We find that existing
defenses, though effective on their original benchmarks, show clear weaknesses
under our benchmark, underscoring the need for more robust solutions. Our key
insight is that while attack forms may vary, the adversary's intent-injecting
an unauthorized task-remains invariant. Building on this observation, we
propose PromptSleuth, a semantic-oriented defense framework that detects prompt
injection by reasoning over task-level intent rather than surface features.
Evaluated across state-of-the-art benchmarks, PromptSleuth consistently
outperforms existing defense while maintaining comparable runtime and cost
efficiency. These results demonstrate that intent-based semantic reasoning
offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable strategy for defending LLMs
against evolving prompt injection threats.

TL;DR: 本文对现有的TEE容器隔离策略进行了系统分析，设计了自动化分析器识别隔离边界并发现若干关键设计与实现缺陷（信息泄露、回滚攻击、拒绝服务、Iago攻击等），提出改进建议并讨论未来趋势。


<details>

Motivation: 随着TEE在保密计算中的广泛应用，TEE容器作为隔离中间件应能在不信任操作系统和编排层的前提下保护应用，但其隔离策略的有效性尚未被系统评估。

Method: 设计并实现了一个自动化分析器，通过静态与动态手段精确识别TEE容器的隔离边界，评估接口暴露与潜在攻击面；对若干主流TEE容器进行实测与漏洞分类。

Conclusion: 许多TEE容器未能实现其预期的隔离保障，存在严重的安全风险；需要在设计与实现层面加强对隔离边界、回滚保护、资源管理与接口最小化的约束。

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of
confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and
industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of
applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as
middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from
potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while
maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation
strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.
To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an
automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation
boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended
goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information
leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to
guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging
trends in TEE containerization design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着通信从以人为中心转向以机器为中心，业务对速率、时延和可靠性的需求发生根本变化，催生了URLLC的研究需求。

Method: 采用分层分析方法，分别讨论物理层、MAC层及跨层技术，并结合不同行业垂直应用的设计考虑进行综合评述。

Result: 总结了实现1 ms时延与99.999%可靠性之间的矛盾性，归纳了现有技术手段的成效与局限，并提出了面向6G的研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文综述了在5G及6G背景下实现URLLC（超可靠低时延通信）的各类方法，并指出了当前研究中的挑战与未来方向。

Abstract: As the wireless communication paradigm is being transformed from human
centered communication services towards machine centered communication
services, the requirements of rate, latency and reliability for these services
have also been transformed drastically. Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and
Low Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G
systems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use
case to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability
in the range of 99.999\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two
targets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of
work have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In
this article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are
analysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of
latency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is
taken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross
layer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design
consideration for various 5G and beyond verticals. Finally the article
concludes by providing a detailed discussion on challenges and future outlook
with particular focus on the emerging 6G paradigm.

*Fatemeh Roshanzadeh,Hamid Barati,Ali Barati*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出的DRR-MDPF将MDP决策与DRR带宽分配结合，兼顾多指标和公平性，仿真证明其在NDN环境下性能和鲁棒性均优于若干先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDN中内容为中心的架构要求高效队列与资源管理，尤其在动态和高流量条件下，现有策略在公平性、时延、丢包率或复杂度上存在权衡，需一种兼顾多指标决策与公平带宽分配的方案。

Method: 将每个路由器视为一个基于MDP的学习代理，使用带宽、延迟和未满足Interest数等指标计算转发决策概率，同时在数据平面使用DRR为不同流分配带宽。系统通过持续反馈和概率更新调整策略，采用单路径路由以降低复杂度。使用ndnSIM仿真并与SAF、RFA、SMDPF、LA-MDPF比较。

Result: 仿真结果显示DRR-MDPF在吞吐量、Interest满足率、丢包率、内容检索时间和负载均衡等多项指标上显著优于对比策略，并在受限缓存和高流量场景下保持鲁棒性且计算复杂度较低。

Conclusion: DRR-MDPF通过将MDPF的多指标决策与DRR的公平带宽分配结合，能在动态高负载和受限缓存条件下显著提升NDN性能，降低丢包与检索时延并改善负载均衡。

Abstract: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network
architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data
dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN
performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper
introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov
Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)
algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding
decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of
unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation
among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a
learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback
and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that
DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,
RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest
Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load
balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and
heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational
complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric
decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading
to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent,
adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively
addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and
route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

*Mandar R. Nalavade,Ravindra S. Tomar,Gaurav S. Kasbekar*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Apply RMAB/Whittle-index to relay selection; compute indices and pick relay with smallest index; yields improved cost, delay, throughput in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design relay selection policy minimizing packet holding cost in relays for source-destination blocked link scenario with multiple relays.

Method: Model as restless multi-armed bandit, prove indexability, derive Whittle index computation per relay per time slot, implement index-based scheduling policy, evaluate via simulation comparisons.

Result: Prove problem is Whittle-indexable; compute Whittle index per relay per slot; propose policy: transmit to relay with smallest Whittle index; simulations show better average cost, delay, throughput than prior policies.

Conclusion: Relay selection RMAB is Whittle-indexable; index policy is effective and outperforms prior methods in simulations.

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which a source node needs to transmit a
large file to a destination node. The direct wireless link between the source
and the destination is assumed to be blocked. Multiple candidate relays are
available to forward packets from the source to the destination. A holding cost
is incurred for each packet stored at every relay in each time slot. The
objective is to design a policy for selecting a relay in each time slot to
which the source attempts to send a packet, so as to minimize the expected
long-run time-averaged total packet holding cost at the relays. This problem is
an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, which is
provably hard to solve. We prove that this relay selection problem is
Whittle-indexable, and propose a method to compute the Whittle index of each
relay in every time slot. In each time slot, our relay selection policy
transmits a packet to the relay with the smallest Whittle index. Using
simulations, we show that the proposed policy outperforms the relay selection
policies proposed in prior work in terms of average cost, delay, as well as
throughput.

Conclusion: 将数字孪生与A2C结合，可通过合成经验提升训练效率并实现更优的VNF迁移策略，在边缘-核心网络中显著降低延迟和能耗。

Abstract: The growing demand for services and the rapid deployment of virtualized
network functions (VNFs) pose significant challenges for achieving low-latency
and energy-efficient orchestration in modern edge-core network infrastructures.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-empowered
Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent VNF migration that
jointly minimizes average end-to-end (E2E) delay and energy consumption. By
formulating the VNF migration problem as a Markov Decision Process and
utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic model, the proposed framework enables
adaptive and real-time migration decisions. A key innovation of the proposed
framework is the integration of a DT module composed of a multi-task
Variational Autoencoder and a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory network. This
combination collectively simulates environment dynamics and generates
high-quality synthetic experiences, significantly enhancing training efficiency
and accelerating policy convergence. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
performance gains, such as significant reductions in both average E2E delay and
energy consumption, thereby establishing new benchmarks for intelligent VNF
migration in edge-core networks.

Motivation: 解决RAN系统复杂性和海量KPI数据带来的故障检测与性能异常诊断困难，需捕获时序依赖的自适应检测方法。

Method: 使用GAN生成器与判别器构建异常检测模型，Transformer作为时序特征提取骨干，数据预处理采用滑动窗口以保留时间上下文，训练与测试在Spotlight项目提供的RAN KPI数据上进行。

Result: 提出RANGAN：将GAN与Transformer结合的异常检测框架，使用滑动窗口预处理以增强时序依赖捕获。在Spotlight公开RAN数据集上评估，最大在网络争用问题上达83% F1得分。

Conclusion: RANGAN在RAN性能异常检测上是有前景的方法，尤其对网络争用类问题检测效果显著，但需进一步验证在更广泛故障类型和生产部署中的稳健性。

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) systems are inherently complex, requiring
continuous monitoring to prevent performance degradation and ensure optimal
user experience. The RAN leverages numerous key performance indicators (KPIs)
to evaluate system performance, generating vast amounts of data each second.
This immense data volume can make troubleshooting and accurate diagnosis of
performance anomalies more difficult. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of
RAN performance demands adaptive methodologies capable of capturing temporal
dependencies to detect anomalies reliably. In response to these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{RANGAN}, an anomaly detection framework that integrates a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a transformer architecture. To
enhance the capability of capturing temporal dependencies within the data,
RANGAN employs a sliding window approach during data preprocessing. We
rigorously evaluated RANGAN using the publicly available RAN performance
dataset from the Spotlight project \cite{sun-2024}. Experimental results
demonstrate that RANGAN achieves promising detection accuracy, notably
attaining an F1-score of up to $83\%$ in identifying network contention issues.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于MCTS的联合路由与带宽分配方法（DSROQ），结合Lyapunov优化调度，提升LEO卫星网络中的用户体验与公平性，且在业务从延迟敏感转为带宽敏感时，性能瓶颈由调度转向路由和带宽决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address QoS in heterogeneous Internet applications over LEO satellite constellations by jointly optimizing routing, bandwidth allocation, and dynamic queue scheduling to maximize user experience.

Method: Formulate joint routing and bandwidth allocation with soft QoS constraints; use MCTS-inspired search to handle NP-hardness; evaluate candidate actions via Lyapunov optimization-based dynamic queue scheduling; compare using Starlink Phase 1 V2 simulations.

Result: Proposed DSROQ algorithm (MCTS-inspired) with Lyapunov-based scheduling; simulations on Starlink Phase 1 V2 show improved end-user experience and fairness versus benchmark; shift in dominant performance factor from scheduling to routing/bandwidth as traffic becomes bandwidth-sensitive.

Conclusion: DSROQ有效提升LEO卫星网络的QoS表现与公平性；联合决策优于单独调度；性能瓶颈随业务敏感性变化而变化，应关注路由与带宽分配的优化。

Abstract: The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality
of service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural
areas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in
such networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and
dynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining
service performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth
allocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints,
aiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is
introduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth
allocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during
reward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we
compare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm
and a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance
metrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth
decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts
from scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity
changes from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven.

TL;DR: 将分配器元数据集中到一个可编程的轻量级支持核，通过其缓存和高效同步来降低缓存冲突与同步开销，从而提升多线程程序的分配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多核多线程系统中，分配器元数据与用户数据交织导致缓存污染和跨线程同步开销，现有硬件加速器对多线程支持有限，因此需要一种既减少缓存干扰又支持新分配器设计的方案。

Method: 设计并实现一个可编程的轻量级支持核，用于处理分配/释放请求并保存元数据；通过高效跨核数据同步接口与主核通信；将分配器逻辑在支持核上实现以避免元数据侵入用户缓存。

Result: 提出SpeedMalloc，一种将内存分配任务卸载到轻量级支持核心的方案，该支持核心保存分配器元数据并进行跨核同步，从而减少缓存污染和线程间同步开销。

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc在多线程基准上分别比Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento提升约1.75x、1.18x、1.15x、1.23x和1.18x。

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出SwizzlePerf：通过赋予大语言模型（LLMs）硬件感知能力，自动为GPU上分离式架构生成空间内存“swizzling”优化，从而提高内存命中率和性能。与基于运行时搜索的方法不同，SwizzlePerf利用工作负载的内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤后的性能剖面和历史反思，快速生成接近人工专家的硬件专用优化方案。在GEMM上5分钟找到与专家两周等效的最佳模式；在10个内核中为9个生成优化，最高加速2.06×，L2命中率提升70%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的自动化方法在优化GPU内核时效率低，且缺乏人类工程师依赖的硬件感知能力。将硬件知识显式提供给LLM可以缩短搜索时间并生成更接近人类专家的高质量优化。

Method: 构建一个将硬件规格、内存访问模式、过滤过的性能剖面日志和历史反思输入给LLM的系统管道；LLM基于这些信息生成针对分离式GPU架构的spatial swizzling策略并产生代码/变换；通过评估器快速验证并迭代优化，选出最优的swizzling模式。

Result: 在GEMM上，SwizzlePerf在<5分钟内找到与专家2周结果等效的最佳swizzling模式；在10个多样化ML/科学内核中，为9个生成可行的swizzling模式，带来最多2.06×的加速和70%的L2命中率提升。

Conclusion: 硬件感知是性能工程自动化的关键；通过将硬件信息显式提供给LLM，SwizzlePerf能在短时间内生成高质量的空间内存重排（swizzling）优化，显著提升性能与缓存命中率，证明了将人类工程师的硬件直觉编码到LLM中是可行且高效的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

Result: 在单主机和2节点（16 GPU）测试中，相比静态MIG和简单放置，SLO违约率下降约32%（绝对值约1.5），p99延迟改善约15%，吞吐损失<=5%；对LLM（OLMo 2 7B Instruct、vLLM）服务的TTFT p99也提高约10–15%，成本同样<=5%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在主机层可部署的、与具体互连无关的控制器，通过动态MIG重配置、PCIe感知放置和轻量级保护措施，显著降低了噪声邻居对延迟敏感推理的尾延迟和SLO违约。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Proposes CoFormer: split large transformers into smaller parts for collaborative edge inference, optimize decomposition with DeBo, and calibrate to restore accuracy, yielding significant speedup, memory and energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models are too heavy for real-time edge devices; existing offloading or compression approaches either incur high communication costs or poor accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Decomposition-based collaborative inference for transformers

Result: CoFormer decomposes a large transformer into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, aggregates intermediate results, formulates an optimization to minimize latency and accuracy loss under heterogeneous constraints, proposes DeBo algorithm for policy derivation and progressive calibration, achieves up to 3.1x speedup, 76.3% memory reduction for GPT2-XL, and ~40% energy reduction.

Conclusion: CoFormer effectively enables efficient, accurate distributed transformer inference on heterogeneous edge devices via decomposition, optimization, and calibration.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: pdGRASS parallelizes off-tree edge recovery via disjoint subtasks and density-aware ordering, achieving large speedups and comparable or better sparsifier quality


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve parallelism and robustness of feGRASS

Method: analysis of method

Result: runtime speedups 3.9x-8.8x, PCG iteration counts varied 1.2x higher to 1.8x lower, worst-case >1000x

Conclusion: pdGRASS yields significant scalability and performance improvements over feGRASS, especially on skewed inputs and worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.
