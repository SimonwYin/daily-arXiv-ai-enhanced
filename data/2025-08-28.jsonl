However, these static approaches\ncannot consistently achieve optimal performance across different inference\nscenarios, as they lack the flexibility to adapt to varying computational\nrequirements. In this work, we propose HAP (Hybrid Adaptive Parallelism), a\nnovel method that dynamically selects hybrid parallel strategies to enhance MoE\ninference efficiency. The fundamental innovation of HAP lies in hierarchically\ndecomposing MoE architectures into two distinct computational modules: the\nAttention module and the Expert module, each augmented with a specialized\ninference latency simulation model. This decomposition promotes the\nconstruction of a comprehensive search space for seeking model parallel\nstrategies. By leveraging Integer Linear Programming (ILP), HAP could solve the\noptimal hybrid parallel configurations to maximize inference efficiency under\nvarying computational constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that HAP\nconsistently determines parallel configurations that achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance to the TP strategy prevalent in mainstream inference\nsystems. Compared to the TP-based inference, HAP-based inference achieves\nspeedups of 1.68x, 1.77x, and 1.57x on A100, A6000, and V100 GPU platforms,\nrespectively.

We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work.

On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through\nextensive experiments on coding problems.

However, many studies consider\nattacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like\ndropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior\naffect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode\nclients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by\npresenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here,\nto enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference\nmode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model\nvulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong\ninherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering\nthe first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of\narchitectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy.

Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability.

Unlike prior\ndata-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain\ninvariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for\ndata understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce\nFoundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of\nthe full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model\nsingle-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the\nfoundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities\nin the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data\ncompletion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient,\nmodality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal\ndatasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model\narchitectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and\nguiding data acquisition.

However, many studies consider\nattacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like\ndropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior\naffect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode\nclients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions.

However, mainstream approaches\ngenerally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation\nrules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural\nheterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to\nover-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios.

The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges.

Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through\nextensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach\nsignificantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive\nGRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g.,\nPRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g.,\nAPPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the\nreasoning ability of LLM policies.

However, many studies consider\nattacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like\ndropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior\naffect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode\nclients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by\npresenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here,\nto enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference\nmode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model\nvulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong\ninherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering\nthe first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of\narchitectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy. Our\nanalysis provides actionable insight into when models are likely vulnerable,\nwhen they appear robust, and where subtle leakage may persist. Together, these\nfindings reframe how gradient inversion risk should be assessed in future\nresearch and deployment scenarios."}

Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science\nplaces the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify,\nexplain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This\npaper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model\nScience, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which\nrequires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is\nunderstood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations;\nControl, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and\nInterface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve\nhuman calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the\ndevelopment of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems."}
