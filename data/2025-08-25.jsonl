To address this limitation\nand investigate the impact of more ecologically valid backdoor attacks on LD\nmodels, we examine the common data poisoning attack and introduce DBALD, a\nnovel diffusion-based data poisoning framework for generating naturalistic\nbackdoor triggers. DBALD comprises two key components: optimal trigger position\nfinding and stealthy trigger generation.

In this\npaper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular\nstructure elucidation from IR spectra.

For example,\nthey appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,\nand the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour\ndata, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated\noutputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally\nequivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered\nsequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is\ntherefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under\ncyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning\nfrom contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance\nthrough complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and\ncharacterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling\nlayers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape\nclassification, reconstruction, and contour regression."}

In this\npaper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these\nopen-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what\nchallenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting\nthese libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885\ncandidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias\nin ML software.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable.

Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer\nto RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems."}
