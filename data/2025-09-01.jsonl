However, because\nthey have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant\nperformance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We\nexamine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in\nmany data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit\nfloating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower\nprecision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit\naccumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so\nhigh that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor\ncore Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational\nthroughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and\nmaximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and\nregisters). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which\ntypically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean\ndistance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean\ndistance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two\nsingle precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find\nthat across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960\ndimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over\nthe SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed\nprecision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline."}

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when\nquantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis\nindicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in\nboth convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\\% and 37.5\\% increase in\ntest accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities."}

Our pipeline\nemploys a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window\nsegmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and\nz-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative\ninput vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three\ncomplementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged\npolarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion\nclassification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.\n(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10\nordinal classes.

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing\nforgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable\nelimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to\nfocus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief\nrevision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical\ndeduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we\ntake an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic\nstates with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional\nlogic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic\nbackground means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to\nthe epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and\ninstantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking\nfunctions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic\nprogramming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating\nforgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations\naccording to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview\nhighlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators."}

Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS.

We show how\nto use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same\ndomain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a\nfew small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.\nIf a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant\nimprovement in heuristic performance over the baseline.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins.

Additionally, we address the\nchallenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight\nsynthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying\nsignificance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable\nexperimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method\naccurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is\nconsistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying\nsignificance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on\nboth real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed\nframework."}

We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,\nParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that\nour model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates\ntheir strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm\nthe practical value of our model."}

Effectively\nleveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as\nreal-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing\napproaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection\nstrategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where\ndata availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework\ndesigned for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health\narchitecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing\nmodalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging\nspecialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach\ndynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data\nmodalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability\nscenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical\nclinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of\nstay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal\nfusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality\navailability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal\ninformation, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in\nhandling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly\nsuitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous\ndata availability."}

Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable\nparameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard\nLoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first\ninitialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation\nthat can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not\nalways easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from\nthe pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and\nthen express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --\ntraining only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on\nadaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE\ntasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,\nstandard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular\nvalue decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x\ncompared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups."}

To address both privacy\nand fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent\nIntervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational\nautoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular\ndata. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a\ntask-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus\noffering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\\'enyi\ndifferential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness\nin the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for\ngroup-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent\nspace, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across\nprotected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure\nextending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment\nencourages statistical independence between latent representations and the\nprotected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides\nsignificant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse\ndownstream tasks under differential privacy constraints."}

By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating\ndomain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology\nsystems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without\nintegrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our\nmethod jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by\nperforming knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical\npropagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology\nhorizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of\nLINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with\nexisting EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness\nin scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction."}

To this end, we study the\nlargest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those\nattacking image classification models.
