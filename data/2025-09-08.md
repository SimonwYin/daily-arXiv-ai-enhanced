### [1] [Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536)
*Oliver Dunn,Koorosh Aslansefat,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SafeML将SafeML思想迁移到量子领域，使用量子态距离进行模型相关的后分类安全监测，在QCNN和VQC实验中显示出可行性，但对度量选择、量子噪声影响及规模可扩展性的讨论仍不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SafeML方法无法直接应用于QML，因为量子计算在表示和概率输出上与经典计算存在本质差异，因而需要专门的安全机制和适当的距离度量。

Method: 基于经典SafeML思想，将统计距离替换为适用于量子系统的距离度量（例如量子态保真度、量子相对熵或其他量子信息度量），并以模型输出（后分类）为中心进行评估，实验在QCNN和VQC模型上验证。

Result: 实验证明Q-SafeML能在QCNN和VQC上检测到运行数据与训练数据之间的差异，帮助提升系统透明性与安全性，但论文并未详细说明具体量子距离选择的全面比较及其在噪声量子硬件上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了针对量子机器学习（QML）的安全监测方法Q-SafeML，主张使用量子态距离度量来衡量运行数据与训练数据之间的分布差异，从而检测概念漂移并支持人类监督。

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

### [2] [Finance-Grounded Optimization For Algorithmic Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04541)
*Kasymkhan Khubiev,Mikhail Semenov,Irina Podlipnova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将金融指标(夏普比率、PnL、最大回撤)直接构建为损失函数，并引入换手率正则化，以约束头寸变化。实验表明，在用算法交易指标评估时，这些金融导向损失与换手率正则化相比均方误差更优，提升了交易策略和组合优化的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归损失（如MSE）未必与金融交易目标对齐，且未考虑交易成本与换手率，需设计与交易绩效直接相关的损失以提高实战效果。

Method: 将夏普比率、PnL、最大回撤等量化指标转化为可微损失，并在训练中加入对头寸变化的换手率正则化约束；通过回测或模拟交易以算法交易指标（如收益、夏普、最大回撤、换手率）评估模型表现。

Result: 在回报预测任务中，使用金融指标损失+换手率正则化的模型，在PnL、Sharpe与最大回撤等交易指标上均优于使用MSE的基线模型。

Conclusion: 用金融指标设计的损失函数并结合换手率正则化，可显著提升基于回报预测的交易策略绩效，优于传统MSE。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [3] [An Efficient Subspace Algorithm for Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05213)
*Jiaojiao Zhang,Yuqi Xu,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSub通过低维子空间投影和对偶变量，降低资源开销并缓解异构数据下的客户端漂移，具备理论收敛保证且实验有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在大规模深度网络上因数据异质性导致的客户端漂移，以及通信、计算和内存成本过高问题。

Method: 引入子空间投影使本地更新受限于低维子空间，并使用低维对偶变量对齐客户端与全局模型，从而减少信息传输并抑制偏差。

Result: 理论收敛分析说明步长与投影矩阵等因素对收敛性的影响；实验验证FedSub在效率（通信/计算/内存）和对异构数据下的稳健性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedSub在减少通信/计算/内存开销的同时通过低维对偶变量缓解客户端漂移，适合大规模神经网络的联邦学习。

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

signals that can be used to anticipate human behavior, health trends, and vital
parameters. Human activity recognition (HAR) is fundamentally connected to
these vital signs, providing deeper insights into well-being and enabling
real-time health monitoring. This work presents i-Mask, a novel HAR approach
that leverages exhaled breath patterns captured using a custom-developed mask
equipped with integrated sensors. Data collected from volunteers wearing the

the approach, achieving over 95\% accuracy and highlighting its potential in
healthcare and fitness applications.

### [5] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExIt通过选择性把中间历史当作新任务起点、只训练单步迭代并配合探索，能让LLM在推理阶段进行更长且有效的自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自我改进训练假定固定最大迭代深度，既成本高又任意，作者希望通过利用自我改进任务的递归结构，在训练时只用单步信息获得能在推理时多步迭代的策略。

Method: 提出Exploratory Iteration(ExIt)，在训练过程中选择性采样episode中最有信息的中间部分历史作为新的任务起点，结合显式探索机制保持任务多样性，只用单步迭代训练自我改进策略。

Result: 在竞赛数学、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt在单一或多个初始实例上均能学得在未见任务上的强推理时自我改进策略，并能在超出训练平均迭代深度的步数预算内持续提高表现。

Conclusion: ExIt能有效训练LLM在推理时进行多步自我改进，通过只训练最有信息量的单步迭代起点来扩展任务空间，从而在训练深度有限下仍能泛化到更长的迭代预算。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

### [6] [Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583)
*Jiequn Han,Kui Ren,Nathan Soedjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种面向每个测试实例的自适应采样框架，通过基于当前预测迭代地细化训练集，针对逆问题学习构建紧凑且信息丰富的训练数据，从而在复杂先验或高精度需求下显著提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于先验的固定数据集训练在先验维度高或精度要求高时需要大量样本，数据采集成本高；因此希望为特定测试实例动态分配采样以提高样本效率并降低成本。

Method: 对每个待求解的测试实例，基于当前模型预测迭代生成和选择训练样本，动态分配采样资源，逐步使训练数据集中在逆映射在该实例周围的几何结构上，从而提高学习效率。

Result: 在逆散射问题上、针对两类结构化先验的实验表明：自适应方法在先验更复杂或要求更高精度时优势更明显，且方法易于扩展到其他逆问题。

Conclusion: 面向实例的自适应采样能在高维复杂先验或高精度场景下显著减少所需训练样本量，且方法可推广到其他逆问题，作为固定数据集训练的一种可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEI提出用平滑近似和集成多样性提升解释忠实性，新增隐藏层忠实性度量，实验显示在可视化和量化指标上均优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对神经推断的解释需要既可解释又忠实的解释方法，现有方法在忠实性与可视化质量之间存在权衡，且对隐藏层编码的评估不足。作者旨在扩展忠实性范围并提升评估与可视化的质量。

Method: FEI通过对现有评估基准的分析，引入平滑近似（smooth approximation）以提高定量忠实性分数；同时采用多样化的集成变体来增强对隐藏层编码的忠实性。论文还提出一种新的定性度量用于评估隐藏层忠实性，并通过广泛实验验证方法有效性。

\textbf{F}aithfulness-guided \textbf{E}nsemble \textbf{I}nterpretation
(\textbf{FEI}), an innovative framework that enhances the breadth and
effectiveness of faithfulness, advancing interpretability by providing superior
visualization. Through an analysis of existing evaluation benchmarks,
\textbf{FEI} employs a smooth approximation to elevate quantitative
faithfulness scores. Diverse variations of \textbf{FEI} target enhanced
faithfulness in hidden layer encodings, expanding interpretability.
Additionally, we propose a novel qualitative metric that assesses hidden layer
faithfulness. In extensive experiments, \textbf{FEI} surpasses existing
methods, demonstrating substantial advances in qualitative visualization and
quantitative faithfulness scores. Our research establishes a comprehensive
framework for elevating faithfulness in neural network explanations,
emphasizing both breadth and precision

*Han Zhang,Fengji Ma,Jiamin Su,Xinyue Yang,Lei Wang,Wen-Cai Ye,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于量子化学描述符与指数任务加权的多任务学习框架QW-MTL，用于ADMET分类，在13个TDC基准上联合训练并优于单任务方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为单任务学习，未能充分利用任务间互补性，且训练与推理资源开销大，需一种统一、高效且能共享信息的多任务框架。

Method: 在Chemprop-RDKit骨干上融合量子化学描述符作为分子表示增强，并提出指数任务加权机制：结合数据集规模先验与可学习参数实现动态损失平衡，进行13个TDC分类基准的联合训练。

Result: 在使用排行榜风格数据切分的标准化评估下，QW-MTL在13个任务中有12个显著超过单任务基线，展示出高预测性能、低复杂度和快速推理。

Conclusion: QW-MTL在ADMET分类任务上通过量子化学描述符和指数任务加权成功提升了多任务学习性能，显著优于单任务基线，且模型复杂度低、推理快。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

### [9] [Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于d-prime、silhouette、ROC-AUC的定量框架，系统比较RSA、线性映射、Procrustes、soft-matching等表征相似性度量的可分离性，发现更严格对齐提高区分力，soft-matching最优，RSA也表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经科学与AI中常用的表征相似性度量缺乏对不同模型家族区分能力的系统比较，研究旨在量化这些度量在大规模模型与大脑比较中的敏感性与实用性。

Method: 提出了一个定量框架，使用三种可分离性指标（d-prime、silhouette系数、ROC-AUC）评估多种相似性度量（RSA、线性可预测、Procrustes、soft-matching），并在不同架构（CNN、ViT、Swin、ConvNeXt）与训练范式（监督/自监督）之间测试区分能力。

Result: 实验显示：严格对齐约束提升可分离性；soft-matching在映射类方法中可分离性最高；Procrustes次之，线性可预测较弱；RSA等非拟合方法亦能实现良好区分。结果为度量选择提供了指导。

Conclusion: 本文通过可分离性视角系统比较表征相似性度量，结论是：随着对齐约束更严格，可分离性增强；在需拟合映射的方法中，soft-matching最好，其次是Procrustes，再次是线性可预测性；非拟合方法（如RSA）也具有较强可分离性。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

### [10] [Split Conformal Prediction in the Function Space with Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04623)
*David Millard,Lars Lindemann,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在输出函数上离散化并逐步细化，扩展分割保形预测到函数空间，提出半径分解与回归校正并引入诊断指标，实现了在无限维情形下的有限样本覆盖且在分辨率转移与超分辨率任务中效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对神经算子在无限维输出下缺乏有限样本覆盖保证的问题，现有方法要么依赖强分布假设（GP、贝叶斯NN），要么覆盖过于保守，需提出一种能在函数空间提供有限样本覆盖的通用方法。

Method: 采用两步策略：1）在输出函数上施加离散化映射，将函数值映射到有限维向量并在该空间应用分割保形预测以获得有限样本覆盖；2）分析离散化细化的渐近收敛，将有限维覆盖保证提升回函数空间，同时将保形半径分解为离散化、校准与失配三部分，并提出基于回归的校正方法以在不同分辨率间传递校准。还设计了两个诊断指标（保形集合体分数与内部一致性）以评估自回归设置下的预测退化。

Result: 实证显示该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且波动较小，并在超分辨率任务中实现更好的覆盖表现。

Conclusion: 本文提出将分割保形预测扩展到函数空间，通过在输出函数空间中引入离散化映射，先在有限维空间建立有限样本覆盖保证，再通过细化离散化将保证提升到函数空间，从而在无限维设置下实现不确定性量化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

### [11] [Fundamental bounds on efficiency-confidence trade-off for transductive conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04631)
*Arash Behboodi,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 跨导依从预测中存在置信度—效率的不可避免权衡；在有不确定性的数据上，任何非平凡置信度会导致预测集大小随样本数呈指数增长，速率由条件熵和色散决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨导依从预测在同时预测多个样本时是否能在保证预设置信度下保持高效（小预测集），并刻画样本数与不确定性对预测集规模的影响。

Method: 通过构造严格的有限样本下界，基于条件熵和对数条件概率方差（称为色散dispersion）的信息-统计量，证明了预测集大小的下界；在理想化情形下给出可实现的上界；并在所有测试点共享相同标签的特殊情况，把问题归约为带经验统计量的假设检验，构建渐近最优的置信预测器并分析误差指数。

Result: 证明了一个有限样本的严格界：预测集大小在样本数增加时以基于条件熵线性放大的指数速率增长，第二阶项由对数条件概率的方差（色散）决定；该界在某些理想化模型中是可达的；并在同标签特例中给出渐近最优方案与误差指数。

Conclusion: 对于跨导依从预测（transductive conformal prediction），论文得出：在保有置信度的同时，预测集效率必然下降，存在置信度与效率间的基本权衡。任何非平凡置信水平在具有内在不确定性的数据上都将导致预测集大小呈指数增长。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

### [12] [Interpreting Transformer Architectures as Implicit Multinomial Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04653)
*Jonas A. Actor,Anthony Gruber,Eric C. Cyr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: attention dynamics recover optimal classification features


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explain attention via multinomial regression link

Method: analysis of methods

Result: transformer attention dynamics align with optimal latent features in multinomial regression

Conclusion: attention can be interpreted as performing feature recovery for multinomial regression

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DNN/RNN非参数框架直接从动物长期学习行为数据反推学习规则，能恢复模拟规则并在小鼠数据上提高预测，揭示非马尔可夫和正确/错误不对称更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定参数化学习规则或简化任务（例如bandit），不能解释动物在de novo任务中从零学起的复杂学习过程；需要灵活模型捕捉次优性、历史依赖与丰富刺激整合，直接从行为数据推断学习规则。

Method: 用深度神经网络对单次试次的策略权重更新进行参数化（非参数化框架），再扩展为循环神经网络以捕捉非马尔可夫历史依赖；在仿真中验证能恢复真实规则，并应用于小鼠感知决策任务的长期学习行为数据，进行交叉验证和预测评估。

Result: 模型在模拟数据上成功恢复地面真实规则；在真实小鼠数据上，RNN/DNN模型在预测保持外数据上优于基线，揭示了正确与错误试次后的不对称更新及历史依赖，支持非马尔可夫学习过程。

Conclusion: 作者提出了一个非参数化框架并用DNN/RNN去拟合每次试次的策略权重更新，从行为数据直接反推学习规则，结果显示能恢复模拟中的真实规则并在小鼠长期学习数据上提升预测性能。

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

Abstract: In today's fast-paced digital communication, the surge in network traffic
data and frequency demands robust and precise network intrusion solutions.
Conventional machine learning methods struggle to grapple with complex patterns
within the vast network intrusion datasets, which suffer from data scarcity and
class imbalance. As a result, we have integrated machine learning and deep
learning techniques within the network intrusion detection system to bridge
this gap. This study has developed TrailGate, a novel framework that combines
machine learning and deep learning techniques. By integrating Transformer and
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architectures with advanced feature
selection strategies and supplemented by data augmentation techniques,
TrailGate can identifies common attack types and excels at detecting and
mitigating emerging threats. This algorithmic fusion excels at detecting common
and well-understood attack types and has the unique ability to swiftly identify
and neutralize emerging threats that stem from existing paradigms.

### [15] [Beyond Ordinary Lipschitz Constraints: Differentially Private Stochastic Optimization with Tsybakov Noise Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04668)
*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在TNC和梯度高阶矩有界条件下，论文给出在差分隐私下随机凸优化的上界和匹配下界，且上界不依赖损失的Lipschitz常数，刻画了样本数、维度、隐私预算和高阶矩对误差的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放宽以往工作中对损失函数Lipschitz常数有界的假设，转而用TNC与梯度高阶矩有界来刻画噪声与光滑性，从而分析在更弱假设下的DP-SCO可行性和极限性能。

Method: 构造基于私有化梯度的算法（利用高阶矩条件对梯度截断或缩放），在(varepsilon,delta)-DP和ho-集中DP下分析其高概率效用界；对不同TNC参数theta(尤其theta\ge2)分别给出解析，并通过信息论或构造难例证明对应的私有最小化下界。

Result: 当theta\ge2且Lipschitz时，提出的(varepsilon,delta)-DP算法在高概率下的效用为\tilde{O}((\tilde{r}_{2k}(1/\sqrt{n}+(\sqrt{d}/(n\varepsilon)))^{(k-1)/k})^{\theta/(\theta-1)})，并扩展到已知下界\bar{\theta}>1的情形；在\u0003varepsilon较小且非Lipschitz时仍可得到\tilde{O}((\tilde{r}_{k}(1/\sqrt{n}+(\sqrt{d}/(n\varepsilon)))^{(k-1)/k})^{\theta/(\theta-1)})上界。下界方面，任意\u0003theta\ge2时，\rho-零集中DP的私有最小化速率下界为\Omega((\tilde{r}_{k}(1/\sqrt{n}+(\sqrt{d}/(n\sqrt{\rho})))^{(k-1)/k})^{\theta/(\theta-1)})。

Conclusion: 该论文在差分隐私下的随机凸优化(DP-SCO)中，假设总体风险满足Tsybakov噪声条件（TNC）且梯度有有界高阶矩，提出了在梯度仅有高阶矩约束而Lipschitz常数可能很大或无界时的差分隐私算法及其误差界，给出上界与相应的下界，体现了在高阶矩约束下对隐私-效用权衡的刻画。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

TL;DR: 提出可解释的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KAN)检测AGC系统中的FDIA，通过提取符号公式兼顾准确性与可解释性，检测率约96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测方法易被隐蔽的FDIA规避，且黑盒机器学习方法缺乏可解释性。本工作旨在引入既准确又可解释的检测模型，以提高AGC系统的网络安全性并便于审计与信任。

Method: 离线训练KAN以学习AGC测量之间的复杂非线性关系，随后对训练好的网络提取符号公式，利用符号公式或原始模型进行FDIA检测。

Result: The paper proposes using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems, focusing on interpretability via symbolic equation extraction and handling system nonlinearities. The model is trained offline and achieves detection rates up to 95.97% for the initial network and 95.9% for the extracted symbolic formula, with low false alarm rates.

Conclusion: KAN能在考虑非线性的前提下高效检测FDIA，并通过符号公式提供良好可解释性，检测性能接近原始模型且误报率低，适合作为增强AGC网络安全的方案。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNN-LSTM models trained on simple noisy polynomial time series can detect flickering in diverse simulated and empirical data, offering a flexible deep-learning approach for early-warning detection of instability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect early warning flickering (noise-driven state switching) as a sign of reduced resilience preceding critical regime shifts; current early warning methods limited, deep learning unexplored for flickering detection

Method: CNN-LSTM on synthetic polynomials

Result: CNN-LSTM trained on noisy polynomial-generated time series accurately identifies flickering; generalizes to various stochastic systems and real-world datasets (dormouse body temperature, African Humid Period proxies)

Conclusion: Deep learning (CNN-LSTM) can learn generic features of flickering from simple synthetic data and reliably detect it in complex stochastic and empirical time series, enabling broad early-warning applications

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAFT提出将GDB转为知识图并用学习驱动的图对齐+整数规划合并，实现对线性与非线性实体的高质量地图合并，效果显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地图合并方法主要针对线性对象且基于启发式规则，无法扩展到非线性实体且缺乏数据驱动的配对能力，导致GDB仍存在区域覆盖或实体缺失问题。

Method: 方法包含三部分：一是将每个GDB构建为知识图；二是利用知识图对齐方法和地理特征编码器进行地图匹配以学习驱动的实体配对；三是用混合整数线性规划进行一致性合并，避免冲突。

Result: 实验表明KRAFT在地图融合任务上显著优于现有方法，且其地图匹配和地图合并模块也分别优于传统匹配与合并方法。

Conclusion: KRAFT通过将地理数据库表示为知识图并结合学习的图对齐与地理特征编码以及整数规划的合并步骤，实现了对线性与非线性实体的通用且一致的地图合并，显著优于现有启发式方法。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过对比学习把姿态信息对齐到sEMG表示（CPEP），显著改善了手势分类能力，尤其是对未见手势的零样本识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量结构化数据（如视频、骨架）在手势分类上效果好，但传感器受限的可穿戴设备更常使用低成本的sEMG，作者希望通过跨模态对齐把结构化模态的有利信息迁移到sEMG上，提高可穿戴设备上的连续手势预测能力并实现零样本分类。

Method: 提出Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP)框架，使用对比学习将EMG编码器学习到的表示与高质量的姿态（pose）表示对齐，从而使EMG表示包含姿态信息；通过线性探测（linear probing）与零样本评估验证性能。

Result: 在实验中，CPEP相比基线emg2pose，在同分布手势分类上提升最多21%，在未见（分布外）手势分类上提升最多72%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CPEP方法通过对齐EMG与姿态表示，能显著提升弱模态（EMG）表示质量，实现零样本手势分类，实验证明在训练集内和未见手势上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NSF把优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p-指数二阶矩扩展与周期性调度，在不改模型数据的前提下动态重加权频段，改善泛化、加速训练并揭示优化器频谱偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对训练中频谱行为讨论多为模型或数据角度，忽视了优化器自身的频谱偏好。揭示并可控化优化器频谱作用可优化训练路径并提高效率。

Method: 提出NSF：用p指数扩展二阶矩估计（允许正负指数），并配合周期性调度实现频谱重加权，无需改动模型或数据。

Result: 理论与实验证明：自适应方法偏向低频，SGD接近中性，负p放大高频；周期性调度扩大频谱覆盖并导致早期决策边界对齐，固定超参下test error下降，在某些任务上以1/4训练成本达到基线准确率。

Conclusion: 优化器具有固有的频谱偏好，通过周期性重加权频段（NSF）可以控制频谱覆盖并改善泛化和收敛。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 
提出CoVeR：一种基于保形预测的无模型解码策略，能在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时提供1-α的覆盖率保证，理论上给出PAC风格泛化界。



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 
现有自回归预训练模型的主流解码方法（如beam search）在生成多样性和覆盖长尾重要轨迹方面存在不足，且缺乏可证明的覆盖性保证。为了解决效率与覆盖性之间的权衡，提出一种既紧凑又有覆盖率理论保证的解码方法。


Method: 
方法上，CoVeR在生成时不依赖模型内部参数或训练过程，而是在解码阶段利用保形预测技术来构造预测集（candidate set），通过某种置信校准或分数函数筛选候选轨迹，从而在控制集合大小的同时保证覆盖率。理论部分给出PAC式泛化界说明明其覆盖率保证。


Result: 
论文的主要结果是提出CoVeR算法并证明其在大样本极限下以至少1-α的概率覆盖目标轨迹（PAC-style保证）。此外，作者可能在实验部分展示了该方法在复杂推理任务上相比传统解码策略在覆盖性与搜索效率之间的优势（摘要未给出具体实验数据）。


Conclusion: 
该论文提出了CoVeR，一种基于保形预测（conformal prediction）的无模型解码策略，旨在在保持搜索空间紧凑的同时，保证对“可取轨迹”的高覆盖率。作者声称给出了PAC风格的理论保证，保证随着样本量增加，覆盖率至少达到1-α。


Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con通过替换KL与相似核系统性搜索更合适的损失，在聚类、对比学习和降维上均显著优于基于KL的方法，强调散度与相似核选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架指出很多表征学习方法隐式最小化KL散度，但KL的非对称性和无界性可能与真实目标不一致并带来优化困难，因而探索更多散度与相似核有望改进性能。

Method: 在I-Con的基础上扩展搜索空间，用不同的散度（如总变差TV、有界f-散度）和不同相似性核（角度核、基于距离的核）替换原先基于KL的损失；在无监督聚类（修改PMI算法）、监督对比学习和降维任务上对比实验验证。

Result: (1) 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类上，用TV替换PMI中的KL达到了SOTA；(2) 在监督对比学习中，使用TV和基于距离的相似核优于传统的KL与角度核；(3) 在降维任务中，将KL替换为有界f-散度，获得更好的定性结果和下游任务表现。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Beyond I-Con框架，通过在表征学习中系统化地探索替代统计散度（如TV距离和有界f-散度）与相似性核，发现KL并非总优且可能导致优化问题，替换后在多项任务上取得更好效果。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: 提出VARMAformer，将VARMA统计模型思想与Cross-Attention-only Transformer结合，通过VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor和VARMA-Enhanced Attention捕捉局部AR/MA模式与全局长程依赖，在多数据集上优于现有SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管cross-attention-only Transformer高效且精准，但可能忽视传统统计模型（如VARMA）擅长的细粒度局部时序依赖，二者结合可互补优势。

Method: 在Cross-Attention-only骨干上引入两个模块：1) VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE)：在patch级别显式建模AR和MA项以提取局部统计特征；2) VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten)：通过时间门控调整query，使注意力更具时序上下文感知。融合后用于捕获局部与全局依赖并用于预测。

Result: 在常用基准数据集上的大量实验显示，VARMAformer稳健优于现有SOTA方法，在精度和效率上均有提升。

Conclusion: 将经典VARMA统计结构融入精简的cross-attention-only Transformer，能同时捕获局部统计依赖与全局长程关系，从而显著提升时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Motivation: 现有节点遗忘方法要么对GNN结构有严格限制，要么没能充分利用图拓扑信息，甚至破坏图的拓扑，导致性能与复杂度之间难以取得平衡。论文旨在设计既能保留拓扑信息又能高效移除敏感节点的通用方法。

Method: 提出三种方法：1) Class-based Label Replacement：通过基于类别的标签替换来减少模型对敏感节点的依赖；2) Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability：利用图的拓扑结构，计算邻居节点的平均后验概率以引导遗忘过程；3) Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering：基于类别一致性过滤邻居节点，从而在保持拓扑结构的前提下实现有效遗忘。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，提出的方法在模型效用、遗忘效用和遗忘效率三方面均优于最先进的节点遗忘方法，能有效移除敏感训练节点并保护隐私，同时兼顾性能与计算复杂度的平衡。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了三种针对图神经网络(GNN)的节点遗忘方法，旨在高效移除敏感训练节点信息以保护隐私，分别为类标签替换(Class-based Label Replacement)、拓扑引导的邻居均值后验概率(Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability)和类一致性邻居过滤(Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering)。其中后两者有效利用图拓扑信息，提高了遗忘效果。实验在三个基准数据集上验证了方法在模型效用、遗忘效用和遗忘效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

TL;DR: 受人脑仲裁机制启发，作者提出ACED-DQN：通过多样化DQN集成和基于近期误差的仲裁控制，显著缓解持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机来自人脑前额叶在决策中的仲裁机制，作者认为人类通过并行多个决策系统并对其进行仲裁来在连续学习中保持稳定与可塑性的平衡，借鉴此机制以解决RL的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 方法由两部分组成：1) 构建一个由多种DQN变体组成的多样化集成，显式训练以获得多样化的价值函数；2) 设计一个仲裁控制器，根据代理在近期试验中的可靠性（误差小）优先选择执行动作。整体框架在训练过程中动态选择高可靠性代理，从而保持已有知识并适应新任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，ACED-DQN在多项基准测试中比单一DQN及未仲裁的集成方法表现更好，能在任务切换或持续学习场景中保持较低的错误率与较高的累积回报，证明仲裁控制结合多样化价值函数的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于仲裁控制的多智能体集成方法（ACED-DQN），用于缓解深度强化学习在持续强化学习环境中的灾难性遗忘问题。实验证明在静态和持续环境中均能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

TL;DR: 比较多种深度学习模型并提出CNN-RNN混合方法用于从原始前额EEG信号中分割检测眨眼，在公开数据集上对健康人和帕金森患者均取得良好结果，健康组准确率≈94–96%，帕金森组≈74–76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眨眼率及其变异性是重要的生理指标，可用于监测认知负荷、注意力及神经系统疾病，因传统将眨眼视为工艺伪影而被忽视，急需准确的自动检测方法。

Method: 将眨眼检测视为序列到序列分割任务，使用最少预处理的原始EEG信号，比较多种深度学习架构（RNN、CNN、深度可分离CNN、TCN、Transformer及混合模型），并测试1、3、5个前额电极通道配置；在UCSD公开数据集（31人，含15名健康者和16名帕金森患者）上训练和评估。

Result: 在健康受试者中，CNN-RNN混合模型分别在1、3、5通道上达到了93.8%、95.4%、95.8%的检测准确率；在帕金森病患者中对应为73.8%、75.4%、75.8%。总体上，增加通道数带来小幅提升，混合模型优于单一架构。

Conclusion: 本文证明了使用深度学习进行EEG眨眼检测是可行且有效的，尤其是CNN-RNN混合模型在不同通道配置下表现最佳；模型在健康人群上准确率高（>93%），在帕金森病患者上较低但仍有实用性（~74%）。

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 用迭代比例拟合把混淆矩阵归一化为双随机矩阵，能把分布偏差从类混淆中分离出来，揭示真实的类相似性，并与模型表征空间建立几何对应，便于更准确诊断与改进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵的值受类相似性和训练/测试集分布偏差共同影响，难以区分两者，从而妨碍对模型错误来源的准确诊断和针对性改进。

Method: 采用迭代比例拟合（bistochastic normalization / Sinkhorn-like IPF）对混淆矩阵进行双重归一化，使行和列和均一致，恢复隐藏的类间相似结构，并将该归一化与模型内部类表征的几何解释联系起来。

Result: 双随机化归一化能更好地揭示类间相似性，克服标准行/列归一化的局限；并且与模型内部表征空间存在对应关系，使得归一化具有几何解释，帮助更深入理解分类器。

Conclusion: 本文提出使用双随机化归一化（迭代比例拟合，IPF）来分离混淆矩阵中的类相似性和分布偏差两类误差来源，从而更准确地诊断分类器行为。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA combines spectral projection and NODEs to fix PINNs' spectral bias and causality issues, improving training and prediction on linear/nonlinear wave PDEs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve PINNs convergence on complex initial-value PDEs by addressing causality violation and spectral bias

Method: Read the abstract

Result: NeuSA, a spectral-basis projection + Neural ODE integration, yields faster convergence, better temporal consistency, higher accuracy on wave equation benchmarks

Conclusion: NeuSA outperforms standard MLP-PINNs via spectral representation, causal NODE integration, and spectral initialization, validated on canonical wave equation benchmarks

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型体积大、计算开销高，不适合资源受限或实时检测的脑电(EEG)癫痫检测应用；因此需要轻量化且保持可靠性的模型。

Method: 构建一维CNN基线模型，训练时采用适度早停防止过拟合；基于卷积核重要性评分对卷积层进行结构化剪枝，移除50%卷积核，然后评估剪枝后模型性能。

Result: 基线模型准确率92.78%，macro-F1 0.8686；剪枝后在减少50%权重与内存的情况下，精确率略升至92.87%，macro-F1提升到0.8707，表明剪枝消除了冗余并改善了泛化。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝结合轻量级一维CNN与适度早停能在不损失性能的前提下显著降低模型参数与计算资源要求，适合资源受限的实时癫痫检测场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在现实应用中常因混合分布漂移、小批量和在线标签不平衡等情况失效或导致性能下降，需找出不稳定原因并设计鲁棒高效的适应方法。

Method: 分析BN层导致TTA不稳，转而采用组归一化或层归一化，但仍存在坍塌问题；提出SAR（选择性剔除大梯度噪声样本+sharpness-aware熵最小化）稳定训练；在此基础上构建SAR^2，加入冗余正则化以降低特征维间相关性和不均等正则化以増加原型中心预测熵，防止表征偏向单类。

Result: 实验显示SAR和SAR^2在上述恶劣测试场景下相比现有方法更稳定、效率更高，减少了模型坍塌、梯度异常和表示过度相关等问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SAR和SAR^2方法可以在测试时适应（TTA）场景下提高稳定性，减少模型坍塌为单一标签、缓解梯度爆炸与表示相关性问题，从而在混合分布漂移、小批量和在线不平衡标签等极端场景下表现更稳健。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising

necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析各种神经网络权重初始化方法在深层网络中的表现，并提出结合每层深度信息的改进初始化策略。

Method: 在初始化时将每层和总网络深度信息纳入方差计算，设计可调节的方差增长机制，实验验证与比较现有初始化方法的效果。

Result: 提出了一种新的初始化方法，灵活地随层深度增加激活方差，实验显示优于现有初始化方案。

Conclusion: 传统保持全网络单位方差的假设在深层网络中效果欠佳，需随深度提高方差。新方法利用每层深度信息调整方差，提升训练性能。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

*Noorul Wahab,Ethar Alzaid,Jiaqi Lv,Adam Shephard,Shan E Ahmed Raza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MultiSurv通过DeepHit+跨模态注意力融合临床、MRI、RNA-seq和病理图像，实现对前列腺与膀胱癌复发时间的个体化预测；在CHIMERA挑战中对前列腺表现优良、对膀胱表现一般。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将异构生物医学数据（临床、影像、组学、病理）联合建模，利用多模态信息提高肿瘤复发时间预测的准确性与个体化风险分层能力。

Method: 模型基于DeepHit扩展：在各模态上使用投影层将特征映射到统一表示，并采用跨模态交叉注意力模块捕捉模态间互补信息，最后输出离散时间段的生存分布以预测time-to-event。采用5折交叉验证并在CHIMERA开发集上验证。

Result: 在前列腺癌生化复发预测（Task1）上，5折CV C-index=0.843，开发集0.818；在膀胱癌复发预测（Task3）上，5折CV C-index=0.662，开发集0.457，表明对前列腺癌效果较好、对膀胱癌表现有限。

Conclusion: 该文提出了MultiSurv模型，通过多模态深度学习（基于DeepHit、投影层与跨模态自注意力）融合临床、MRI、RNA-seq与病理切片特征，实现个体化生存（复发）时间预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

*Tim Dernedde,Daniela Thyssens,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在构建式神经组合优化中引入循环编码器以复用前一步嵌入，减少模型深度和延迟，同时保持或提升解质量，在TSP/CVRP/OP及大邻域搜索中均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建式NCO中连续步骤之间状态变化较小，理应复用先前步骤的计算，但现有方法通常在每步重新编码整个状态，导致计算冗余与较高延迟。

Method: 设计一个递归/循环的编码器：每步编码器接收当前状态和上一步的嵌入作为输入，以复用先前计算并减少重复计算；在相同或更少层数下训练该编码器，并与非递归基线比较。将模型应用于TSP、CVRP和OP，并整合到大邻域搜索框架中评估实用性。

Result: 在TSP、CVRP和OP上，循环编码器在层数减少约3倍的条件下仍能达到相当或更优的性能，显著降低推理延迟；在与大邻域搜索结合时展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该论文提出通过在构建式NCO中使用循环编码器复用前一步计算，从而在保持或提升性能的同时显著降低模型层数与延迟。

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

### [41] [HyPINO: Multi-Physics Neural Operators via HyperPINNs and the Method of Manufactured Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05117)
*Rafael Bischof,Michal Piovarči,Michael A. Kraus,Siddhartha Mishra,Bernd Bickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO 用 Swin Transformer 超网络 + MMS 标签 + 物理无监督训练，实现对多类二维参数化 PDE 的零次泛化与高精度解，且通过迭代“增量”PINN 集成大幅降低误差，同时加速并改善 PINN 微调收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经算子与 PINN 在泛化到不同 PDE 实例（几何、边界、源项变化）时常需针对性微调或训练开销大。目标是设计一个可扩展的、无须任务特定微调即可实现零样本泛化的框架，兼顾解析标签与物理约束，扩展神经算子的适用性至更复杂、多样的参数化 PDE。

Method: 使用 Swin Transformer 作为超网络骨干，接收 PDE 参数（几何、边界条件、源项等），输出目标 PINN 的权重或网络表示。训练时采用混合监督：一方面用 MMS 生成解析解作为有标签数据，另一方面用物理信息损失对无标签样本进行约束。引入迭代细化流程：比较生成 PINN 解与 PDE 的物理不符之处，训练生成“delta”PINN，将其与先前解相加形成集成，从而逐步减少残差。还评估了用 HyPINO 初始化的 PINN 在微调下的收敛性，与随机初始化及 Reptile 元学习对比。

Result: 在七个 PINN 基准问题上实现了强零样本准确率，平均显著优于 U-Net、Poseidon 和 PINO。迭代细化集成在六个基准上持续降低误差，最佳情况下平均 L2 损失降低超过 100 倍。用 HyPINO 初始化的 PINN 在五个基准上收敛更快且到达更低最终误差，在其余两个基准上表现相当。

Conclusion: HyPINO 是一种基于超网络的多物理神经算子，能够在无需任务特定微调的情况下对多类参数化 PDE 实现零次泛化；通过混合监督（MMS 生成的解析解标签 + 物理约束无标签样本）训练，并用 Swin Transformer 架构映射 PDE 参数到目标 PINN。该方法在多项基准上优于 U-Net、Poseidon 和 PINO，并通过迭代细化生成“增量”PINN 集成显著降低误差，同时保持前向推理；对 HyPINO 初始化的 PINN 进行微调能更快收敛且最终误差更低。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

*Davide Pirovano,Federico Milanesio,Michele Caselle,Piero Fariselli,Matteo Osella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 细粒度标签训练并非万灵药，其是否有益取决于数据几何结构、标签层级一致性、样本量与模型容量等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多数据集的类标签天然呈层级结构，观察到用更细粒度标签训练有时能提升目标级别的分类性能，研究该现象的普遍性与成因以指导实践。

Method: 结合真实数据集与合成数据实验，构建不同几何结构和层级关系的场景，系统评估在不同数据规模和模型容量下细粒度训练对目标层级分类性能的影响。

Result: 发现细粒度训练的效用具有条件性：当数据的类簇在特征空间中以某些几何关系排列且细粒度标签与目标标签的分割有利时，可带来提升；但在其它结构或样本不足/模型容量受限时，可能无益甚至有害。

Conclusion: 训练使用更细粒度标签并非总能提升分类准确率，其效果依赖于数据的几何结构、标签层级与数据分布的关系，以及数据量和模型容量等因素。

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

### [43] [On the Learnability of Distribution Classes with Adaptive Adversaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05137)
*Tosca Lechner,Alex Bie,Gautam Kamath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文定义并研究了带预算的自适应对手下的分布可学习性，证明在加法性扰动模型中自适应对手使得可学习性严格更难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗模型多为oblivious对手，现实对手可能能在看到样本后修改样本（自适应），因此需要研究自适应对手对分布类可学习性的影响并引入预算约束的刻画。

Method: 针对带有预算约束的自适应对手定义了一个通用的可学习性概念；分析了加法性对手模型，比较了自适应与非自适应两种情形下的可学习性条件，并构造性地证明了严格性（存在在非自适应下可学但在自适应下不可学的分布类或反之）

Result: 提出了考虑对手预算的自适应可学习性定义；证明了在加法性扰动下，自适应可学习性比非自适应可学习性更严格（即存在分布类在oblivious下可学而在adaptive下不可学）

Conclusion: 在存在自适应对手的情形下，一些分布类别的可学习性比在非自适应（oblivious）对手下更难获得；具体而言，对抗性为加法性扰动时，自适应对手情形下的可学习性严格强于仅考虑加法性非自适应对手的可学习性。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

*Dmitry Akulov,Mohamed Sana,Antonio De Domenico,Tareq Si Salem,Nicola Piovesan,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种注意力引导且层自适应的复合token KV缓存压缩方法，兼容现有推理引擎，显著减少内存占用且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存随着上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的内存瓶颈。现有方法在启发式、张量布局或计算内核方面存在缺陷，亟需一种既高效又兼容现有推理流水线的压缩方案。

Method: 通过聚合注意力分数估计token重要性，独立为每个注意力头选择重要token，并将这些token对齐成满足统一缓存结构的复合token；同时引入全局分配机制在层间自适应分配保留预算，优先保留信息量较大的层。

Result: 在同等或更低的内存占用下，本方法在多个基准上保持或优于先前的结构化与半结构化压缩方法，证明了其在内存-精度权衡上的优势和实际部署可行性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力引导、层自适应的复合token的KV缓存压缩框架，兼顾了压缩效率与推理兼容性，能够在保持模型精度的同时显著减少缓存内存占用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

*Bastien Dubail,Stefan Stojanovic,Alexandre Proutière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 后继测度本身非低积，但跳过初始几步后的后继测度呈现低秩，基于此给出理论误差界与新型Poincaré不等式，并在目标条件RL中验证可提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多RL方法（如无奖励/目标条件RL）隐含假设后继测度低秩，但作者指出这一假设不严谨，因而寻找更合理的低秩结构以改善近似与估计性能。

Method: 提出并研究了“位移后继测度（shifted successor measure）”的低秩近似问题，给出采样条目下的逐项估计的有限样本界；引入并证明了新的Type II Poincaré不等式以界定谱可恢复性，并建立位移量与局部混合性质的联系，同时通过实验验证效果。

Result: 证明原始后继测度通常非低秩，而位移后继测度可被有效低秩逼近；给出条目级估计的有限样本误差界，误差由谱可恢复性决定；提出Type II Poincaré不等式以界定所需位移并连接局部混合性；实验显示在目标条件RL上移位有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文认为传统假设的后继测度自身低秩不成立，而适当“位移”（跳过初始若干步）后的后继测度呈现低秩结构，从而更适合低秩近似与估计。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

TL;DR: 基于CESAR1运行数据，作者用多种LSTM变体和ConvLSTM构建高精度（>99%）时序预测模型，预测胺类排放和四个关键运行参数，并通过±20%扰动的因果分析识别了可用于减排和优化运行的关键操作变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减小胺基溶剂排放、提升胺基后燃烧捕集系统运行性能和稳定性，需要实时、高精度的预测与决策支持；传统模型受限于建模复杂性和实时性，数据驱动深度学习可提供更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 作者利用来自Technology Center Mongstad的CESAR1溶剂试验运行数据，构建并比较了四种时间序列深度学习架构（Basic LSTM、Stacked LSTM、Bi-directional LSTM、Convolutional LSTM）对排放（AMP和Piperazine）和四个系统性能参数（CO2产物流量、吸收塔出口温度、脱气后烟气出口温度、RFCC塔底温度）进行预测；并通过对八个输入变量在±20%范围内扰动结合因果冲击分析，评估变量对目标的影响。

Result: 所建模型预测精度超过99%，能同时跟踪稳态趋势和突发波动；因果冲击分析显示，调整精脱溶剂温度和洗涤水处理等操作参数可显著降低胺排放并改善系统性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出并验证了基于深度学习的监督回归模型，用于对胺类排放和捕集器关键运行参数进行高精度预测，并通过因果冲击分析评估操作变量的影响，具有实用的监测和决策支持价值。

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DRL模型计算需求增长，训练大型模型的环境与经济成本（能耗、温室气体排放、金钱成本）受关注，但现有研究多侧重算法的学习效率，而缺乏系统的能耗与成本评估。

Method: 使用Stable Baselines实现7种主流DRL算法（DQN、TRPO、A2C、ARS、PPO、RecurrentPPO、QR-DQN），在10个Atari 2600游戏上分别训练1百万步，实时测量功耗并估算总能耗、CO2当量排放和基于美国全国平均电价的电费。

Result: 发现算法间能效差异显著：例如ARS比DQN节能最多可达24%，在碳排放方面有时可低近68%，不同算法间训练成本差异可达到约68%（如QR-DQN vs RecurrentPPO）。还分析了学习性能、训练时间、能耗与成本之间的权衡，指出可在不牺牲性能下通过算法选择减小环境与经济影响。

Conclusion: 本工作表明不同DRL算法在能耗、碳排放和训练成本方面存在显著差异，且在保持学习性能的同时可以通过算法选择显著降低环境和经济成本。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Motivation: 随着deepfake和图像伪造增多，图像真伪鉴别变得更具挑战性。结合空间和频域信息有助于捕捉不同类型的伪造痕迹，从而提高检测鲁棒性并减少误报。

Method: 构建两条分支的CNN：一条处理空间域特征（可能是RGB或灰度块），另一条处理频域特征（例如DFT/DCT或高通滤波响应）；在各自分支提取特征后进行融合，并通过Siamese网络比较，生成64维嵌入用于分类。

Result: 在CASIA 2.0上报告77.9%准确率，优于传统统计方法；论文声称在计算开销和检测性能间取得平衡，便于实用部署，但与更复杂的大型管线相比性能较弱。没有提供更多基准（如精确率/召回/F1或其他数据集对比）。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一个结合空间与频域特征的双分支卷积神经网络用于图像篡改检测，方法在CASIA 2.0数据集上达到77.9%准确率，优于传统统计方法，但弱于更大更复杂的系统。作者强调模型在计算复杂度和检测可靠性间的折衷，适合实际部署。

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

TL;DR: Represent distributed ADMM as a GNN message-passing model, learn per-iteration hyperparameters conditioned on iterates via end-to-end training on unrolled ADMM to accelerate and improve distributed optimization while keeping convergence properties


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM is effective for distributed problems but can be slow and sensitive to hyperparameters; leveraging GNNs to adapt hyperparameters based on local iterates could speed convergence while respecting decentralization

Method: Unrolling ADMM into a learnable GNN framework

Result: A GNN predicts adaptive step sizes and communication weights per node/edge; unrolled ADMM with learned hyperparameters trained end-to-end improves convergence speed and solution quality in experiments

Conclusion: Learned adaptive hyperparameters via a GNN lead to faster, higher-quality convergence than standard ADMM across tested problem classes, with code publicly available

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出DRL-PUT，一个基于深度强化学习的个性化效用调优框架，用于广告排序系统中的多目标优化；通过在请求状态下预测最优超参数并直接学习策略，避免估值函数带来的不稳定性；在Pinterest在线A/B实验中显著提升CTR与长点击率，并做了奖励定义和个性化分析的消融研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工调参面临目标不明确、参数空间巨大、缺乏个性化和对季节性自适应能力差等问题，需要自动化、鲁棒且可个性化的多目标优化方法。

Method: 将效用调参表述为RL任务：状态为广告请求特征，动作为预测的线性组合超参数；直接用在线日志离策略学习策略网络，避免估值函数的高方差问题；在生产环境进行A/B测试并做奖励/个性化消融分析。

Result: 在线A/B实验结果：在处理组上，CTR提升9.7%，长点击率提升7.7%；并通过消融研究证明奖励设计和个性化策略对性能的影响。

Conclusion: DRL-PUT能有效替代手工线性效用调参，通过在线日志直接学习策略模型，实现个性化和自适应的超参数选择，从而在实际系统中显著提升广告点击和长点击等关键指标。

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

### [52] [NEXUS: Efficient and Scalable Multi-Cell mmWave Baseband Processing with Heterogeneous Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04625)
*Zhenzhou Qi,Chung-Hsuan Tung,Zhihui Gao,Tingjun Chen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: NEXUS enables real-time, energy-aware virtualized multi-cell mmWave baseband on one heterogeneous server by combining ACC100 acceleration, RAF prediction for resource allocation, and a power-aware scheduler, achieving high throughput and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meet stringent flexibility, scalability, and efficiency needs of 5G NR mmWave baseband processing in vRANs, especially for multi-cell deployments with heterogeneous workloads and limited compute resources.

Method: Integrates software DSP pipelines with hardware-accelerated LDPC on Intel ACC100 eASIC shared via virtual functions; uses a RAF-based predictor for single-cell energy-efficient resource allocation and a power-aware scheduler with a contention model for multi-cell scenarios.

Result: Supports up to 16 concurrent FR2 cells under full load with 5.37 Gbps aggregate throughput, microsecond-level RAF inference, high accuracy, and orders-of-magnitude reduction in multi-cell scheduling search space.

Conclusion: NEXUS demonstrates virtualized multi-cell mmWave baseband processing on a single heterogeneous server is practical and efficient, achieving high throughput and scalability while reducing scheduling complexity.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of 5G New Radio (NR), particularly in the millimeter-wave
(mmWave) spectrum, imposes stringent demands on the flexibility, scalability,
and efficiency of baseband processing. While virtualized Radio Access Networks
(vRANs) enable dynamic spectrum sharing across cells, compute resource
allocation for baseband processing, especially in multi-cell deployments with
heterogeneous workloads, remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
NEXUS, the first system to realize real-time, virtualized multi-cell mmWave
baseband processing on a single server with heterogeneous compute resources.
NEXUS integrates software-based digital signal processing pipelines with
hardware-accelerated LDPC decoding, and introduces a novel framework for
sharing Intel's ACC100 eASIC across multiple CPU cores via virtual functions
(VFs). For single-cell operation, NEXUS employs a random forest (RAF)-based
model that predicts the most energy-efficient resource allocation for the given
cell configuration with microsecond-level inference latency and high accuracy.
For multi-cell scenarios, NEXUS introduces a power-aware scheduler that
incorporates a lightweight contention model to adjust resource allocation
strategies under concurrent execution. Through extensive evaluation across
various Frequency Range 2 (FR2) cell configurations, we show that NEXUS
supports up to 16 concurrent cells under full load, achieving 5.37Gbps
aggregate throughput, while reducing the multi-cell scheduling search space by
orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that virtualized, resource-aware
baseband processing is both practical and efficient for next-generation vRAN
systems.

TL;DR: 在真实SCION部署中，路径高度动态且不对称，MPQUIC等多路径协议需考虑高抖动与路径不对称的设计因素以保证性能与可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对实际路径态势（稳定性、多样性、性能）的经验数据，阻碍多路径协议设计

Method: 在全球SCIONLab测试床上进行长期测量，分析控制面变动、路径多样性、性能指标并评估MPQUIC的影响

Result: 发现控制平面剧烈抖动、局部路径寿命短、路径不对称现象以及多路径并发在吞吐与延迟/可靠性之间的权衡

Conclusion: SCION网络高度动态，路径寿命短且存在路径不对称，需为多路径协议设计额外机制

Abstract: Path-aware networks promise enhanced performance and resilience through
multipath transport, but a lack of empirical data on their real-world dynamics
hinders the design of effective protocols. This paper presents a longitudinal
measurement study of the SCION architecture on the global SCIONLab testbed,
characterizing the path stability, diversity, and performance crucial for
protocols like Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC). Our measurements reveal a dynamic
environment, with significant control-plane churn and short path lifetimes in
parts of the testbed. We identify and characterize path discrepancy, a
phenomenon where routing policies create asymmetric path availability between
endpoints. Furthermore, we observe a performance trade-off where concurrent
multipath transmissions can improve aggregate throughput but may degrade the
latency and reliability of individual paths. These findings demonstrate that
protocols such as MPQUIC should explicitly account for high churn and path
asymmetry, challenging common assumptions in multipath protocol design.

*Erik Rye,Dave Levin,Robert Beverly*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究表明IPv6时代家庭网络更易暴露设备，NAT曾作为事实防火墙；作者设计轻量级IPv6扫描方法并在全球范围测量，发现比IPv4扫描可触及更多易受攻击的终端设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网向IPv6过渡，住宅网络不再强制使用NAT，可能使原本被NAT隐藏的设备变得可公开访问，必须评估此迁移是否增强了IoT僵尸网络的攻击能力。

Method: 提出一种可在低资源设备上运行的大规模IPv6扫描方法（非AI依赖），并用其扫描住宅网络以采集设备响应，统计各协议端口与设备类型的可达性，同IPv4全网扫描结果对比。

Result: 在118个国家、2436个自治系统内收集到来自14.0M个不同IPv6住宅地址的响应，包含telnet、FTP、iPhone-Sync、IPP等协议。与IPv4对比，IPv6能触达更多打印机、iPhone和智能灯具。

Conclusion: IPv6普及使家庭网络暴露性增加，NAT曾充当事实上的防火墙，向IPv6迁移可能提升IoT僵尸网络攻击面。

Abstract: IPv4 NAT has limited the spread of IoT botnets considerably by
default-denying bots' incoming connection requests to in-home devices unless
the owner has explicitly allowed them. As the Internet transitions to majority
IPv6, however, residential connections no longer require the use of NAT. This
paper therefore asks: has the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 ultimately made
residential networks more vulnerable to attack, thereby empowering the next
generation of IPv6-based IoT botnets? To answer this question, we introduce a
large-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can
be run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets. We use this methodology
to perform the largest-scale measurement of IPv6 residential networks to date,
and compare which devices are publicly accessible to comparable IPv4 networks.
We were able to receive responses from 14.0M distinct IPv6 addresses inside of
residential networks (i.e., not the external-facing gateway), in 2,436 ASes
across 118 countries. These responses come from protocols commonly exploited by
IoT botnets (including telnet and FTP), as well as protocols typically
associated with end-user devices (including iPhone-Sync and IPP). Comparing to
IPv4, we show that we are able to reach more printers, iPhones, and smart
lights over IPv6 than full IPv4-wide scans could. Collectively, our results
show that NAT has indeed acted as the de facto firewall of the Internet, and
the v4-to-v6 transition of residential networks is opening up new devices to
attack.

*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EDSAC框架并结合定量与定性证据表明：LLMs目前适合用于决策支持，而非替代人工作伦理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在具有伦理敏感性和高风险的施工项目管理决策中的可行性与可靠性。

Method: 混合方法：使用EDSAC对两种领先LLM在12个真实伦理情景中进行量化测试；并对12位行业专家进行半结构化访谈以获取定性认知。

Result: LLMs在法律合规模块表现尚可，但在情境细微差别、责任明确与推理透明度方面存在显著不足；行业专家倾向于人机协同并反对AI独立做伦理判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在施工项目管理中的伦理判断尚不可靠，适合作为辅助工具而非独立决策者。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个同时搜索代理结构与配置的整体优化器，通过利用回溯文本反馈在预算约束下高效提高LLM代理性能，显著优于现有提示优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器通常只调整节点配置而固定图结构，导致无法修复由结构设计引起的失败。需要一种能同时探索结构和配置的优化方法，以全面提升LLM代理的可靠性与性能。

Method: 提出框架无关的优化器Maestro，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置，在给定的rollout/token预算约束下最大化代理质量。利用文本化的回溯（traces）反馈来指导优先级编辑，从而提高样本效率并针对特定失败模式优化。与现有提示优化器比较，进行对比实验并在基准与应用场景中验证效果。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA上，Maestro平均超过MIPROv2、GEPA、GEPA+Merge分别为12%、4.9%、4.86%；仅限提示优化时仍领先9.65%、2.37%、2.41%。在采样效率上也优于GEPA，并在面试官和RAG代理两个实际应用中展现大幅提升，证明联合搜索能修复提示调优无法解决的结构性问题。

Conclusion: Maestro提供了一个同时搜索代理结构（图）和配置（模型、提示、工具等）的整体优化框架，相较于只调优配置的方法能更好地解决结构性失败模式，在多项基准与应用中显著提升性能。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

TL;DR: 为了解决健康仿真模型解释的可达性问题，本文提出一个面向利益相关者的分步框架，通过需求采集、可控LLM调优与多维评估，实现为不同背景的健康利益相关者生成定制化仿真解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M&S模型（如基于主体的模型）虽有助于健康决策，但因复杂性导致对非专家利益相关者不可及，现有LLM生成的解释常为一刀切，无法满足不同群体多样化的信息和风格需求。

Method: 采用混合方法：一是通过访谈/调查等方式收集临床医生、决策者、患者、护理者和健康倡导者等不同群体的解释需求与风格偏好；二是基于这些需求对LLM进行可控属性调优，指导模型生成定制化文本；三是通过多维度评估指标对生成的解释进行评估并迭代改进。

Result: 提出并实现了一个分步框架，包括需求采集、LLM可控调优与综合评估，展示了这一方法能更好地生成符合不同利益相关者需求的仿真解释（论文内通过实证或实验评估以支持该结论）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出一种用于为不同健康利益相关者生成定制化仿真解释的框架，旨在提高复杂M&S模型的可访问性和可用性，从而更好地支持决策与个人健康选择。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI基准难以捕捉模型在物理世界建模中的细腻能力，且缺少对人类认知特征的量化引导；因此需要一种以人类认知为中心的评估方法来提升可解释性与实际应用相关性。

Method: 基于Perception Test与OpenEQA基准，作者通过深度访谈和大规模问卷调查提取关键认知技能（如Prioritization、Memorizing、Discerning、Contextualizing），并将这些技能编码为可用于增强基准设计的评价维度和指标，最后提出了一个将人类评价融入基准的框架与设计指南。

Result: 研究表明参与者认为AI在解释性和同理心相关能力上欠缺，但对AI性能有较高期望。将人类认知维度纳入基准后，能够更全面反映模型在实际任务中的表现，为基准设计提供可操作的准则和改进路径。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将人类导向的评估标准整合进现有物理世界建模基准，以增强模型行为的可解释性与适用性，强调用户中心的评估以使AI能力更贴合人类认知过程。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,

Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into

of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human

Motivation: 复杂、长时间跨度的多智能体任务（如机器人足球）在结构单一的高保真模拟中由于探索空间过大和稀疏奖励导致训练失败，亟需显式的、层级化的世界模型来引导学习。

Method: 系统综述2024年多智能体足球领域研究，识别出将符号/层级方法与MARL结合的趋势，并提出用大语言模型在线生成层级任务脚手架的范式。

Result: This position paper argues for hierarchical, explicit World Models in complex multi-agent tasks like robotic soccer and proposes using LLMs to dynamically generate hierarchical scaffolding to improve learning efficiency and strategic behavior.

Conclusion: 通过语言可配置的层级任务层构建明确的世界模型，可以显著缓解探索难题、稀疏奖励问题，并促进从低级反应行为到高级战略团队协作的迁移。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主要是被动反应，缺乏系统性地探索假设性未来（事前预测行动后果）的能力，限制了在战略、风险评估和实时决策等场景的应用。

Method: 引入What-If Analysis框架，利用强化学习从环境反馈中学习，动态模拟每个潜在动作的多步结果，并在Honor of Kings游戏中验证。

Result: 在Honor of Kings实验中，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化上的准确率达到74.2%，比基线提升最多达2倍，特别是在高难度场景中收益显著。

Conclusion: WiA-LLM通过将What-If Analysis与环境反馈（强化学习）结合，使LLM具备前瞻性、模拟后果的能力，从而提升在动态复杂环境中的决策和预测表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XRL工具覆盖孤立且生成的解释难以为领域专家理解，导致专家难以选择工具或信任RL策略，故提出一个能用自然语言交互、自动匹配工具并生成多样化、可操作解释的系统。

Method: 构建包含Coordinator、Explainer、Coder、Evaluator、Debugger五个专责LLM代理的框架：Coordinator负责解析用户查询并调度XRL工具；Explainer生成基于关键状态变量、期望结果或反事实的自然语言解释；Coder将反事实或策略描述转为可执行规则/代码；Evaluator评估解释或生成场景的合理性与影响；Debugger处理执行失败并修复生成过程。通过在四罐过程控制问题上将用户查询映射为XRL任务并进行交互式生成与验证，评估准确率和生成成功率。

Result: 在四罐过程控制基准上，TalkToAgent成功将用户查询映射为XRL任务并高准确率调用工具，Coder-Debugger交互显著减少反事实生成失败，定性评估表明生成的解释能把策略动作放在领域上下文中进行有意义的解读。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent通过多智能体LLM架构实现了交互式自然语言可解释增强，能够自动选择合适的XRL工具并生成多样化解释（包括扩展的反事实和规则化策略），在非线性四罐基准上表现有效，且编码-调试协同降低了生成反事实时的失败率。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Motivation: 随着语言模型被部署到长期、多方的在线交互环境，需要理解其在多方博弈中是否会倾向合作或竞争，并研究长期交互中行为如何演化以及与人类协作的潜力。

Method: 将多种语言模型作为代理，参与Axelrod式锦标赛，对战240种已知古典策略；通过行为统计分析（如合作率、报复性、慷慨性）和策略切换实验评估模型的长期互动与应变能力。

Result: 语言模型在对抗古典策略的锦标赛中表现良好，展现出"善良"、"易被挑衅但随后原谅"和"慷慨"等合作特征，且在对手策略中途切换时能在几轮内迅速适应，达到了或超过人类的适应速度。

Conclusion: 语言模型在迭代囚徒困境中能够表现出与最优古典策略相当甚至更优的长期合作行为，具有重要的合作性和适应性特征。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Motivation: 将重复性通话任务自动化以降低成本、提升可用性，并复制顶尖人工坐席的流程以实现规模化服务。

Method: 从电话录音语料中构建流水线：ASR->LLM对话管理->TTS，结合领域选择、知识抽取与提示工程，基于表现优异的人工坐席学习脚本并进行流式推理与评估。

Result: 在22项指标盲测中，AI在介绍、产品说明等例行任务表现接近人类，但在销售推动与异议处理上表现较差；通过分析并调整提示有所改进。

Conclusion: AI语音助手能在常规通话任务中接近人类表现，但在说服与异议处理上仍有差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

TL;DR: OSC在代理选择与结果聚合之间加入知识感知的中间层，使代理能感知并弥合认知差距，促进更深度的协作，提升效果与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高多智能体系统中专家型LLM代理之间的深度协作效率，通过引入中间层以改善代理间的语言互动，从而增强认知协同。

Method: 引入Collaborator Knowledge Models(CKM)用于建模同伴的认知状态，进行实时认知差距分析，并基于学习的策略动态调整沟通内容、细节和表达风格，作为选择与聚合之间的中间层。

Result: 提出OSC框架及协作者知识模型(CKM)，实现实时认知差距分析与基于学习的自适应沟通策略，实验显示在复杂推理与问题求解基准上可显著提升任务性能与通信效率。

Conclusion: OSC有效将并行工作的独立代理转变为深度协作的认知团队，优化多智能体协作流程并提供对LLM代理交互行为的新见解。

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SparkUI-Parser：用连续坐标回归替代离散自回归输出，并配合token路由器、坐标解码器与改进匈牙利拒识机制，实现更精确、更快、可解析整界面的GUI感知；并构建ScreenParse评测集，实验证明优于SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在GUI感知中受限于离散坐标自回归生成导致精度低、速度慢，且只能识别预定义元素集，无法解析整个界面，需要提高定位精度、解析细粒度和泛化能力。

Method: 基于预训练多模态大语言模型，作者用连续坐标建模替代离散文本自回归输出，增加token路由器和坐标解码器来直接回归坐标；引入基于修改匈牙利匹配算法的拒识机制以识别并剔除不存在元素；并构建ScreenParse评测集用于结构化界面解析评估。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和新建的ScreenParse等基准上，SparkUI-Parser在定位精度、解析覆盖率和推理速度上均优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SparkUI-Parser通过连续坐标建模、token路由器与坐标解码器，以及基于改进匈牙利匹配的拒识机制，有效提升了GUI感知任务的定位精度与解析精细度，同时加速推理并减少误报；在多个基准上超过现有SOTA并提供了ScreenParse基准。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出把定性会话特征用语言学描述符量化并形式化进本体，通过描述逻辑约束指导LLM微调生成，实验证明能更一致且可解释地控制CEFR级别对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为会话代理时难以保证响应的可控性和与用户个性化需求的一致性，尤其是在表现语言能力级别（如CEFR）方面缺乏透明、可解释的控制手段。

Method: 通过定义一组语言学描述符（如词汇复杂度、句子长度、语法多样性等），为定性概念构建量化指标；将这些指标映射到CEFR级别的逻辑规则，并用描述逻辑形式化入本体；利用本体对生成文本进行一致性检验，并通过微调LLM使其在生成时满足本体约束。

Result: 所提框架成功将定性会话特征形式化为可推理的本体规则，并在微调的LLM上展示出更可解释且一致的CEFR级别控制效果，提升了生成文本的透明度和可控性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于本体的方法，将定性会话特征通过语言学描述符量化并形式化为描述逻辑，从而用于对话中可控的语言能力级别（以CEFR为例）的约束与生成。实验表明该方法在一致性、可解释性方面有提升，并能引导LLM生成符合目标水平的对话文本。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DOVIS五层协议与AgentRank-UC算法，用最小隐私聚合实现性能感知的代理排名；仿真与理论结果显示该方法在收敛性、鲁棒性与抗Sybil方面可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具备推理能力的LLM驱动的自治代理增多，需要一种基于实际表现（而非宣称能力）的排序机制来选取可靠代理；但代理使用信号分散且私有，需新的协调协议以在保护隐私同时聚合有效信号。

Method: 提出五层协议DOVIS（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义），定义数据收集与隐私保护机制；在该基础上设计动态信任感知算法AgentRank-UC，把使用频率与能力指标（质量、成本、安全性、延时）合并为统一排名；并通过仿真实验与理论分析证明其收敛性与鲁棒性。

Result: 通过仿真实验与理论证明，DOVIS能够在碎片化私有环境中收集最小聚合指标，AgentRank-UC在多种攻击与噪声场景下展示了收敛、稳健及对Sybil攻击的抵抗力，支持性能驱动的代理市场。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了DOVIS协议与AgentRank-UC算法，旨在通过最小隐私聚合数据实现代理的可验证排序，从而推动“Web of Agents”的发展。结论是：协调的协议能够在隐私保护前提下收集足够信号，AgentRank-UC在模拟与理论上显示出收敛性、稳健性与抗Sybil攻击能力，证明了性能感知的代理排名是可行的。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS用“sticker”引导的多轮历史经验重用，结合三模型协同与模仿+自我改进训练，在数学推理任务上比传统冗余采样方法更高效、更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样且忽视历史经验的利用，导致计算效率低下；通过利用历史尝试的关键信息可在有限推理预算下提高性能。

Method: 提出一个由三个协同LRM组成的测试时扩展框架：信息提取器、重用与精炼器、候选生成器；引入“sticker”作为关键条件在多轮中提取、精炼和重用重要信息；两阶段优化策略先模仿学习再自我改进以逐步提升性能。

Result: 在AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH三项数学推理基准上，Sticker-TTS在相似推理预算下持续优于自洽（self-consistency）及先进的强化学习方法，展示了sticker驱动历史经验利用的有效性。

Conclusion: Sticker-TTS通过引入“sticker”键条件并协调三大LRM进行多轮探索与改进，有效利用历史尝试，提升测试时扩展效率，实验证明在数学推理基准上优于自洽与强化学习方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

Motivation: 人在社交环境中经常需要判断何时及如何提供帮助，但独立目标使合作困难。目标是构建一个能给出有用、针对性且具情境性的反馈系统以促进利他行为。

Method: ProToM先用贝叶斯逆规划推断个体代理目标的分布，再基于该分布最大化期望效用来选择和时机化反馈；在两个环境（Doors, Keys, and Gems 与 Overcooked）中与基线方法对比评估，并包含人类用户偏好测试。

Result: 实验显示ProToM在成功率、任务完成时间和人类偏好上均优于使用大型语言模型的基线，且通信成本更低、反馈更具时机性和上下文相关性。

Conclusion: ProToM有效通过基于Theory of Mind的推理与期望效用最大化选择反馈，从而在多智能体任务中促进利他行为，优于大型语言模型基线，在成功率、完成时间和用户偏好上表现更好。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Motivation: ODRL作为数字资源访问与使用的事实标准，但缺乏全面的正式语义，导致策略评估与比较存在歧义；因此需要一个直观且与规范一致的形式语义以支持策略验证与比较，尤其在数据共享场景中。

Method: 基于查询问答的语义建模：将ODRL策略的评估形式化为查询回答问题，推导策略在给定事实下的许可/禁止结论，并利用此语义框架进行比较分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld能有效自动化和加速3D场景制作，同时保持高创意质量和物理/视觉逼真度，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

TL;DR: paper calls for research on adapting DP to network environments, highlighting security and topology as key areas


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: identify research gap at intersection of networking and differential privacy

Method: analysis of methods

Result: proposed 'network-aware DP' direction; identified two focus areas: network security and topology

Conclusion: encourage development of DP mechanisms tailored to network conditions and more interdisciplinary research

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy-enhancement technology (PET) that
receives prominent attention from the academia, industry, and government. One
main development over the past decade has been the decentralization of DP,
including local DP and shuffle DP. Despite that decentralized DP heavily relies
on network communications for data collection,we found that: 1) no systematic
study has surveyed the research opportunities at the intersection of networking
and DP; 2) nor have there been significant efforts to develop DP mechanisms
that are explicitly tailored for network environments. In this paper, we seek
to address this gap by initiating a new direction of network-aware DP. We
identified two focus areas where the network research can offer substantive
contributions to the design and deployment of DP, related to network security
and topology. Through this work, we hope to encourage more research that
adapt/optimize DP's deployment in various network environments.

Abstract: Elliptic curve cryptography is better than traditional cryptography based on
RSA and discrete logarithm of finite field in terms of efficiency and security.
In this paper, we show how to exploit elliptic curve with high rank, which has
not been used in cryptography before, to construct cryptographic schemes.
Concretely we demonstrate how to construct public key signature scheme with
hierarchy revocation based on elliptic curve with high rank, where the rank
determines the height of the revocation tree. Although our construction is not
very efficient in some sense, our construction shows elliptic curve with high
rank is valuable and important for cryptographic usage. The technique and
assumption presented can surely be used for other cryptographic constructions.

Motivation: 传统监督方法依赖大量标签，而APT数据极度不平衡且标签昂贵，需一种少样本下仍能高效检测APT的方案。

Method: 设计了注意力对抗双自编码器框架（Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder），并在主动学习循环中选择性查询不确定样本的标签以迭代训练模型。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present a considerable challenge to
cybersecurity due to their stealthy, long-duration nature. Traditional
supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data,
which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning
to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for
labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs
while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn
with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present
a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based
anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop
progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on
real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent
Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data.
The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux,
BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show
substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning,
outperforming existing methods.

*Richard Derbyshire,Diana Selck-Paulsson,Charl van der Walt,Joe Burton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究指出，黑客主义正从抗议转向类似网络战争的攻击，论文提出基于影响、意识形态一致性和东道国参与的分类方法，并提出对东道国与受害国的政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于黑客主义团体自2022年起向攻击关键国家基础设施的运维技术扩展，并在2024年与地缘政治冲突中的党派性行动关联，研究动机是理解这类升级行为背后的战略驱动与国家间复杂互动。

Method: 提出了一个基于行动影响、与国家意识形态对齐程度和东道国参与度的解释模型，用以分类和理解黑客行动者的战略动机与国家关系，并对政策响应进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，部分黑客主义团体在影响力和意识形态上与国家目标有显著重合，东道国可能对其容忍或利用，导致地缘政治冲突中的非国家网络行为日益军事化，亟需调整政策与防御策略。

Conclusion: Escalatory hacktivism is increasingly acting as a quasi-state instrument in geopolitical conflicts, challenging existing legal and policy frameworks and requiring nuanced responses from states and international bodies.

Abstract: Since 2022, hacktivist groups have escalated their tactics, expanding from
distributed denial-of-service attacks and document leaks to include targeting
operational technology (OT). By 2024, attacks on the OT of critical national
infrastructure (CNI) had been linked to partisan hacktivist efforts in ongoing
geopolitical conflicts, demonstrating a shift from protest to something more
resembling cyber warfare. This escalation raises critical questions about the
classification of these groups and the appropriate state response to their
growing role in destabilizing international security.
  This paper examines the strategic motivations behind escalatory hacktivism,
highlighting how states may tolerate, encourage, or leverage hacktivist groups
as proxies in conflicts that blur the lines between activism, cybercrime, and
state-sponsored operations. We introduce a novel method for interpreting
hacktivists based on the impact of their actions, alignment to state ideology,
and host state involvement, offering a structured approach to understanding the
phenomenon. Finally, we assess policy and security implications, particularly
for host and victim states, and propose strategies to address this evolving
threat. By doing so, this paper contributes to international discussions on
cyber security policy, governance, and the increasing intersection between
non-state cyber actors and state interests.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Odoo的子系统，通过模块化设计解决施工外包和分包场景下的劳动力弹性管理与跨站点协同问题，验证系统在高并发与离线环境下的稳健性。

Abstract: In the era of Construction 4.0, the industry is embracing a new paradigm of
labor elasticity, driven by smart and flexible outsourcing and subcontracting
strategies. The increased reliance on specialized subcontractors enables
companies to scale labor dynamically based on project demands. This adaptable
workforce model presents challenges in managing hierarchical integration and
coordinating inter-site collaboration. Our design introduces a subsystem
integrated into the Odoo ERP framework, employing a modular architecture to
streamline labor management, task tracking, and approval workflows. The system
adopts a three-pronged approach to ensure synchronized data exchange between
general contractors and subcontractors, while maintaining both security and
operational independence. The system features hybrid access control,
third-party integration for cross-domain communication, and role-based mapping
algorithm across sites. The system supports varying degrees of customization
through a unified and consolidated attribute mapping center. This center
leverages a tree-like index structure and Lagrange interpolation method to
enhance the efficiency of role mapping. Demonstrations highlight practical
application in outsourcing, integration, and scalability scenarios, confirming
the system's robustness under high user volumes and in offline conditions.
Experimental results further show improvements in database performance and
workflow adaptability to support a scalable, enterprise-level solution that
aligns with the evolving demands of smart construction management.

*Stefanos Vasileaidis,Thanassis Giannetsos,Matthias Schunter,Bruno Crispo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TALOS is a TEE-agnostic framework for secure, verifiable live migration of trusted applications using memory introspection and control-flow verification, minimizing trust and avoiding trusted third parties; prototyped on SGX and Keystone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable secure live migration of Trusted Applications (TAs) across diverse TEEs without relying on trusted third parties, minimizing trust assumptions and ensuring integrity, continuity, and protection against cloning/replay.

Method: Analyze paper

Result: TALOS provides verifiable state management, memory introspection, control-flow graph extraction, and a migration protocol; prototyped on Intel SGX (Gramine LibOS) and RISC-V Keystone; claims portability and suitability for decentralized settings with strong security guarantees and efficiency.

Conclusion: TALOS enables trustworthy migration of TAs by combining state verification and CFG-based integrity checks, supporting decentralized deployment across heterogeneous TEEs while maintaining efficiency and strong security properties.

Abstract: Live migration of applications is a fundamental capability for enabling
resilient computing in modern distributed systems. However, extending this
functionality to trusted applications (TA) -- executing within Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) -- introduces unique challenges such as secure
state preservation, integrity verification, replay and rollback prevention, and
mitigation of unauthorized cloning of TAs. We present TALOS, a lightweight
framework for verifiable state management and trustworthy application
migration. While our implementation is prototyped and evaluated using Intel SGX
with the Gramine LibOS and RISC-V Keystone (evidencing the framework's
portability across diverse TEEs), its design is agnostic to the underlying TEE
architecture. Such agility is a necessity in today's network service mesh
(collaborative computing across the continuum) where application workloads must
be managed across domain boundaries in a harmonized fashion. TALOS is built
around the principle of minimizing trust assumptions: TAs are treated as
untrusted until explicitly verified, and the migration process does not rely on
a trusted third party. To ensure both the integrity and secure launch of the
migrated application, TALOS integrates memory introspection and control-flow
graph extraction, enabling robust verification of state continuity and
execution flow. Thereby achieving strong security guarantees while maintaining
efficiency, making it suitable for decentralized settings.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Dara Ron,Syed Rafiul Hussain,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Y1 analytics exposure enables highly targeted jamming: threshold-based achieves similar damage with lower duty cycle; DBSCAN-based is most efficient under budget limits, highlighting need to secure Y1 access and monitor consumers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Y1 interface shares RAN analytics with consumers, improving optimization but potentially leaking information that adversaries can use to perform targeted interference; need to evaluate security risk.

Method: Implemented two Y1-aided jammers (DBSCAN clustering-based and threshold-based) and compared to always-on and random jammers in an over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed, measuring bitrate impact and transmission duty cycle.

Result: Threshold-based jammer replicates always-on disruption with 27% less transmission; clustering-based jammer achieves up to 18.1% bitrate drop while active 25% of time under constrained budgets, showing trade-off between stealth and efficiency.

Conclusion: Exposure of RAN analytics via Y1 can enable selective, low-overhead jamming attacks; defenders must restrict/monitor Y1 access and apply mitigation.

Abstract: The Y1 interface in O-RAN enables the sharing of RAN Analytics Information
(RAI) between the near-RT RIC and authorized Y1 consumers, which may be
internal applications within the operator's trusted domain or external systems
accessing data through a secure exposure function. While this visibility
enhances network optimization and enables advanced services, it also introduces
a potential security risk -- a malicious or compromised Y1 consumer could
misuse analytics to facilitate targeted interference. In this work, we
demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective
jamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and
evaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging
DBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared
against two baselines strategies -- always-on jammer and random jammer -- on an
over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in
unconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely
replicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing
transmission time by 27\%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the
clustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1\% bitrate
drop while remaining active only 25\% of the time. These findings reveal a
critical trade-off between jamming stealthiness and efficiency, and illustrate
how exposure of RAN analytics via the Y1 interface can enable highly targeted,
low-overhead attacks, raising important security considerations for both
civilian and mission-critical O-RAN deployments.

*Simone Bottoni,Giulio Zizzo,Stefano Braghin,Alberto Trombetta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种将线性同态认证器与安全聚合结合的可验证联邦学习协议，允许客户端在不泄露更新的情况下验证聚合器，具备低开销并可扩展到大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注恶意客户端带来的鲁棒性问题，但忽视了聚合器自身可能作恶（如篡改权重、破坏隐私或偏置模型）。因此需要一种能让客户端验证聚合器行为的方案，同时保持通信和隐私开销低。

Method: 在标准安全聚合的基础上，引入线性同态认证器（linearly homomorphic authenticator），使得对聚合结果进行高效的、隐私保护的验证成为可能。该认证器支持对聚合后的模型参数进行验证而无需暴露单个更新。

Result: 构造在计算与通信开销上保持低成本，能够扩展到拥有数百万参数的大型神经网络，并在实验中演示了对大模型的可行性与效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可验证联邦学习协议，允许客户端在不泄露其本地更新的前提下验证聚合器的计算正确性，防止聚合器恶意篡改或偏置模型。

Abstract: Federated Learning has rapidly expanded from its original inception to now
have a large body of research, several frameworks, and sold in a variety of
commercial offerings. Thus, its security and robustness is of significant
importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of
malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for
example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the
models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning
protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators
computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our
protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual
model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables
efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our
construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator
while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach
scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with
millions of parameters.

### [81] [On Hyperparameters and Backdoor-Resistance in Horizontal Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05192)
*Simon Lachnit,Ghassan Karame*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 通过理论与实验证明，合理设置良性客户端的学习率、批量大小和本地训练轮数等超参数可以显著削弱HFL中的后门攻击，无需额外防御且对主任务影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HFL安全研究常使用自定义的、任意的良性客户端超参数，这可能夸大后门攻击效果并弱化防御评估；因此有必要系统探究超参数如何影响攻击与防御，从而找到无需额外防御即可提升鲁棒性的策略。

Method: 结合理论分析与大量实验测量，研究超参数对后门攻击与防御有效性的影响；在多种最先进攻击-防御组合上进行鲁棒性评估，比较不同超参数设置的攻击成功率和主任务准确率。

Result: 结果表明，调整良性客户端超参数能一致性降低后门攻击成功率（例如显著缩短A3FL攻击的持续时间，50%寿命可减少98.6%），同时主任务准确率仅小幅下降（例如最多2.9个百分点），且对恶意客户端参数选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文结论是：在水平联邦学习(HFL)中，良性客户端的训练超参数（如学习率、批量大小、本地训练轮数）对后门攻击成功率有显著影响；通过合理调参即可在不使用额外防御的情况下大幅削弱后门效果，同时保持主任务准确率。

Abstract: Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) is particularly vulnerable to backdoor
attacks as adversaries can easily manipulate both the training data and
processes to execute sophisticated attacks. In this work, we study the impact
of training hyperparameters on the effectiveness of backdoor attacks and
defenses in HFL. More specifically, we show both analytically and by means of
measurements that the choice of hyperparameters by benign clients does not only
influence model accuracy but also significantly impacts backdoor attack
success. This stands in sharp contrast with the multitude of contributions in
the area of HFL security, which often rely on custom ad-hoc hyperparameter
choices for benign clients$\unicode{x2013}$leading to more pronounced backdoor
attack strength and diminished impact of defenses. Our results indicate that
properly tuning benign clients' hyperparameters$\unicode{x2013}$such as
learning rate, batch size, and number of local epochs$\unicode{x2013}$can
significantly curb the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, regardless of the
malicious clients' settings. We support this claim with an extensive robustness
evaluation of state-of-the-art attack-defense combinations, showing that
carefully chosen hyperparameters yield across-the-board improvements in
robustness without sacrificing main task accuracy. For example, we show that
the 50%-lifespan of the strong A3FL attack can be reduced by 98.6%,
respectively$\unicode{x2013}$all without using any defense and while incurring
only a 2.9 percentage points drop in clean task accuracy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文设计了面向LDP联邦学习的自适应模型中毒攻击，通过在反向训练中加入约束生成对抗更新，能够绕过常见鲁棒聚合方法并大幅破坏全局模型，实验证明其在多种设置下有效，揭示了LDPFL的关键安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDP虽然保护了用户隐私，但联邦学习的去中心化管理使其易受恶意参与者的攻击；现有对抗模型中毒的研究在考虑LDP约束的条件下仍不足，因此需要探讨和构建针对LDPFL的有效攻击方法以暴露风险并推动防御改进。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的模型中毒攻击框架，通过将约束嵌入反向训练过程来生成恶意更新，旨在逃避现有鲁棒聚合机制（如Multi-Krum和trimmed mean）。在三个代表性LDPFL协议、三种数据集和两类深度神经网络上进行了评估，并分析了数据异质性和隐私预算对攻击效果的影响。

Result: 实验表明，提出的自适应攻击能够在不同协议、数据集和模型结构上，大幅降低全局模型的准确率，且在对抗Multi-Krum和trimmed mean等防御时依然有效，攻击强度受数据异质性和隐私预算影响。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了在本地差分隐私联邦学习（LDPFL）中模型中毒攻击（MPA）的严重脆弱性，提出的攻击框架能够在满足本地隐私约束下最大化全局训练损失，从而显著破坏全局模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP)
enables privacy-preserving model training across decentralized data sources.
However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to
participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols,
particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject
malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently
studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning
attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the
objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local
privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as
Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully
crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these
defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL
protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy
budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model,
revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust
LDPFL defense strategies against MPA. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出STADI框架，在异构多GPU环境下通过时空自适应调度（时间上的最小公倍数量化步分配+空间上的弹性补丁并行）提高扩散模型推理效率，可在负载不平衡场景下将延迟最多降低45%，提升资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理计算开销大，且在异构多GPU或存在后台任务时传统并行方案会导致资源未充分利用和负载不均，需新的时空自适应调度策略来提高并行推理效率。

Method: 提出混合调度器：1) 时间维度上，设计计算感知的步分配器（在预热后运行），通过最小公倍数最小化的量化技术减少慢GPU的去噪步数并降低同步开销；2) 空间维度上，采用弹性补丁并行，根据GPU计算能力分配不同大小的图像补丁，配合空间机制平衡负载。

Result: 在负载不均和异构多GPU集群上进行广泛实验，结果显示STADI相比现有补丁并行方法在端到端延迟上最多减少45%，显著提升资源利用率和缓解性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: STADI 在异构或负载不均的多GPU集群中显著改善了负载均衡，缓解性能瓶颈，相比现有补丁并行方法在端到端延迟上最多降低45%，并显著提升资源利用率和吞吐量，适用于扩散模型推理加速。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image
generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their
substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism
inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU
environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause
workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion
Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in
such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained
parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI
introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup
phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to
reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further
minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism
mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to
their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through
a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both
load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,
demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance
bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion
inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference
latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on
heterogeneous GPUs.

Conclusion: VoltanaLLM 能在预填/解码解耦架构中通过相位特定的频率调节与路由决策，显著降低 LLM 推理能耗且不损害延迟服务质量，为可持续的 LLM 部署提供实用方案。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving
the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

Abstract: We present a multi-GPU extension of the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)
pipeline for scientific visualization. Building on previous work that
demonstrated high-fidelity isosurface reconstruction using Gaussian primitives,
we incorporate a multi-GPU training backend adapted from Grendel-GS to enable
scalable processing of large datasets. By distributing optimization across
GPUs, our method improves training throughput and supports high-resolution
reconstructions that exceed single-GPU capacity. In our experiments, the system
achieves a 5.6X speedup on the Kingsnake dataset (4M Gaussians) using four GPUs
compared to a single-GPU baseline, and successfully trains the Miranda dataset
(18M Gaussians) that is an infeasible task on a single A100 GPU. This work lays
the groundwork for integrating 3D-GS into HPC-based scientific workflows,

Result: 实验结果显示，RMA单边通信方法与基于collective的方法在总体性能上相当，但RMA方法存在高初始化开销，限制了其优势；扩展后的Wait Drains可实现高效的后台重配置。

Conclusion: 基于RMA的一面通信方法在数据重分配方面能达到与传统集合化方法相当的性能，并可通过扩展Wait Drains实现后台重配置，但当前高初始化成本限制了其优越性，需要优化初始化以发挥潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the novel one-sided communication methods based on

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show best-in-class performance across a wide
range of natural language processing applications. Training these models is an
extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing
infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive
datasets. Unfortunately, information about the scaling performance and training
considerations of these large training pipelines is scarce in public
literature. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and
practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning
training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we
aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in
particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across
hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully
leveraging available GPU compute capacity.
