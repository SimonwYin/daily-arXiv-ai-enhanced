Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出Grace，一种卫星-地面协作系统，在低轨卫星上部署精简视觉语言模型进行实时推理，在地面站部署更大模型。系统包含异步卫星-地面检索增强生成(RAG)与任务调度算法，通过自适应更新将地面知识库部分同步到卫星，并用置信度测试决定本地处理或下发地面。实测轨道数据表明Grace在不降低精度下将平均延迟降低76–95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是当前大视觉语言模型在遥感任务上表现良好，但真实LEO卫星部署受限于卫星计算能力和短暂的卫星-地面联络窗口，需在延迟、带宽和准确性之间找到平衡以实现近实时应用（如灾害监测）。

Method: 方法包括：(1) 在卫星上部署紧凑LVLM并维护本地知识归档，地面部署大模型与完整知识库；(2) 设计自适应更新算法，在有限链路窗口内将地面RAG知识库的关键部分同步到卫星归档；(3) 提出基于置信度的测试算法动态决定是否在卫星端完成任务或将任务下发至地面站；(4) 异步卫星-地面RAG机制实现检索增强生成以提升推理质量。

Result: 基于真实卫星轨道数据的广泛实验显示，Grace在不牺牲推理精度的情况下，将平均延迟降低76–95%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Grace实现了在受限计算和短时卫星-地面链路下的近实时LVLM推理，显著降低延迟且保持准确性，适合真实LEO遥感场景部署。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated great
potential in remote sensing (RS) tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) conducted by
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. However, their deployment in real-world LEO
satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard
computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a
satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference
in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime
inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end
performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous
satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch
algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite
archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground
data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that
either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.
Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that
Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art
methods, without compromising inference accuracy.

### [2] [A New Hybrid Precoding Approach for Multi-user Massive MIMO over Fading Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24595)
*Azadeh Pourkabirian,Kai Li,Photios A. Stavrou,Wei Ni*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 文章将角度与相位视为相关变量，使用二元高斯分布和联合熵来指导混合预编码设计，仿真显示比现有方法提升约18.31%总速率和11.47%鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合预编码方法未充分利用角度与相位间的统计相关性，本文通过联合建模与信息熵度量来提高预编码的性能与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于数字/模拟串联的混合预编码架构，模拟端用波束形成指向目标方向以最大化主瓣并抑制副瓣；将角度与相位建模为二元高斯分布，定义并利用联合角相位熵更新预编码参数以适应信道变化。

Result: 提出了一种结合数字和模拟预编码的混合预编码方法，通过对角度和相位建模为联合高斯分布并定义联合角相位熵，自适应抑制副瓣干扰并提升总速率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将角度与相位的相关性融入预编码设计并通过联合熵进行适配，可以显著提高MU-MMIMO系统的总速率与抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Hybrid precoding is an indispensable technique to harness the full potential
of a multi-user massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MMIMO) system. In
this paper, we propose a new hybrid precoding approach that combines digital
and analog precoding to optimize data transmission over multiple antennas. This
approach steers signals in specific directions, leading to maximizing sum-rate
and suppressing side-lobe interference. When dealing with complex signals,
changes in phase are naturally associated with changes in angle, and these
variations are inherently correlated. The correlation between the angle and
phase is essential for accurately determining the channel characteristics. An
important aspect of this approach is that we model the angle and phase as
correlated variables following a bivariate Gaussian distribution, and for the
first time, we define a joint angle and phase entropy to measure the
uncertainty of angle and phase variations in wireless channels. This entropy is
crucial to adapt the proposed precoding method with variations. Simulation
result validate the accuracy of our analytical findings, demonstrating 18.31%
increase in sum-rate and an 11.47% improvement in robustness compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [Strategic Task Offloading for Delay-Sensitive IoT Applications: A Game-Theory-Based Demand-Supply Mechanism with Participation Incentives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24611)
*Azadeh Pourkabirian,Amir Masoud Rahmani,Kai Li,Wei Ni*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于VCG拍卖的边缘计算任务卸载方法，将卸载问题建模为供需市场，通过激励机制保证真实性、市场平衡和延迟约束，模拟结果显示社会福利最大化且对用户和边缘服务器有利


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited processing on IoT devices and need for latency guarantees by modeling offloading as market demand-supply to avoid under/over-supply

Method: VCG auction-based task offloading in edge computing for delay-sensitive IoT

Result: Game-theoretic VCG auction mechanism with incentive design that maximizes social welfare, truthfulness, market balance, latency guarantees; simulations confirm effectiveness and profitability for users and edge servers

Conclusion: VCG拍卖与激励机制能够在延迟敏感IoT场景下实现高效公平的资源分配，保证延迟、提高社会福利并激励参与各方

Abstract: Delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications have drawn significant
attention. Running many of these applications on IoT devices is challenging due
to the limited processing resources of these devices and the need for real-time
responses. Task offloading can minimize latency by transferring computationally
intensive tasks from IoT devices to resource-rich edge servers, ensuring delay
and performance guarantees. In this paper, we develop a task-offloading
approach for delay-sensitive IoT applications in edge computing environments.
Unlike existing schemes, we model the task offloading problem as an economic
demand and supply model to achieve market balance. The proposed model avoids
under- and over-supply, ensuring the computational resources at edge servers
(supply) are allocated in a manner that best meets the processing and
computational needs of user devices (demand). Given the multi-agent nature of
task offloading involving users and service providers with different
preferences and objectives, we design a game-theoretic framework using a
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. This framework analyzes agent interactions
and decision-making processes. Additionally, we develop an incentive mechanism
to encourage both parties to participate in the auction. The mechanism
maximizes user task offloading to edge servers and motivates edge servers to
share their computational resources, achieving profitability for both IoT users
and edge servers. Simulations demonstrate our method maximizes social welfare,
ensures truthfulness, maintains market balance, and provides latency guarantees
for delay-sensitive IoT applications.

### [4] [An Enhanced Dual Transformer Contrastive Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23617)
*Phuong Q. Dao,Mark Roantree,Vuong M. Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BERT-ViT-EF（早期融合BERT与ViT）和扩展的对比学习模型DTCN，通过文本预编码层与对比学习提升跨模态对齐，在TumEmo上达78.4%准确率和78.3% F1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过更深的文本上下文建模和早期融合增强跨模态互动以提高多模态情感分析的性能。

Method: 使用BERT处理文本、ViT处理图像，先将文本经额外Transformer层精炼，再进行早期融合；引入对比学习对齐文本与图像表示，并联合训练分类损失与对比损失。

Result: Proposed BERT-ViT-EF and DTCN models for MSA; DTCN achieves SOTA on TumEmo and competitive on MVSA-Single.

Conclusion: 早期融合和文本上更深的上下文建模加上对比学习能显著提升Transformer多模态情感分析性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

### [5] [Speeding Up MACE: Low-Precision Tricks for Equivarient Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23621)
*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用cuEquivariance并对线性层应用BF16/FP16（FP32累加），可在不显著损害MD下实现大幅加速；训练仍应使用FP32。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低SO(3)-等变机器学习力场的计算成本，使高精度MD更经济可行，同时验证低精度和GPU优化内核是否在不损害物理保真度下带来性能提升。

Method: 对MACE模型进行端到端及逐模块性能剖析，比较e3nn与NVIDIA cuEquivariance实现，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16（FP32累加）等数值精度设置，基于可复现的稳态计时进行推理、短NVT与长NPT水体系模拟以及简单训练任务的测量。

Result: cuEquivariance将推理延迟约减少3倍；将线性层置为BF16/FP16（模型其余保持FP32）可再带来约4倍加速；在NVT/NPT MD中能量与热力学观测量保持在运行间变异范围内；训练时若使用半精度权重会导致力RMSE恶化；混合使用e3nn与cuEq模块会因表示不匹配产生问题。

Conclusion: 在保持物理精度前提下，通过使用GPU专用后端和混合低精度数值策略，能显著加速SO(3)-等变力场（以MACE为例）的推理与MD模拟。训练阶段仍建议保留FP32以避免力误差恶化。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

### [6] [Adversarially-Aware Architecture Design for Robust Medical AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23622)
*Alyssa Gerhart,Balaji Iyangar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper empirically shows adversarial attacks threaten dermatology AI, defenses help partly but harm clean accuracy; calls for combined technical, ethical, policy solutions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess vulnerability of healthcare AI (dermatology) to adversarial attacks and evaluate defenses, highlighting patient safety and equity concerns

Method: Empirical experimentation with adversarial attacks on dermatology images, threat modeling, benchmarking defenses (adversarial training, distillation)

Result: Adversarial attacks significantly reduce classification accuracy; defenses (adversarial training, distillation) partially mitigate attacks but trade off clean-data performance

Conclusion: Defenses reduce attack success but require balancing robustness and accuracy; integrated technical, ethical, and policy measures needed for resilient, equitable healthcare AI

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

### [7] [DiNo and RanBu: Lightweight Predictions from Shallow Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23624)
*Tiago Mendonça dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Luís Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种后处理浅层随机森林方法（DiNo、RanBu），用树结构距离或核平滑接近度替代成百上千棵深树，保持或提升精度同时大幅降低延迟与内存；只需训练后操作并调节单一带宽参数h。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少随机森林在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的推理时延和内存开销，同时尽量保持或提升预测精度，尤其希望在高噪声数据下用浅树集合替代大量深树达到更快更小的模型。

Method: 训练常规模型：先训练小规模、深度受限的随机森林；在预测阶段不再生长新树，而是基于树叶节点信息构建观察间距离或接近度矩阵：DiNo计算通过最近公共祖先的cophenetic距离并做距离加权预测；RanBu将Breiman的proximity矩阵用核函数（带宽h）平滑，得到加权预测；带宽h通过轻量级矩阵-向量操作调参。

Result: 提出了两种浅层森林后处理方法DiNo和RanBu，将少量深度受限的树转为高效的距离加权预测器；DiNo基于观察对最近公共祖先的cophenetic距离，RanBu对Breiman接近度做核平滑；两方法仅在训练后操作，只有单一带宽参数h需调节；在合成和25个公开数据集上RanBu在高噪声下能匹配或超越全深度随机森林并显著降低训练+推理时间，DiNo在低噪声情形有更优偏差-方差平衡；两者可扩展到分位数回归；实现开源R/C++包。

Conclusion: RanBu适用于高噪声场景能在速度与精度上优于全深随机森林；DiNo在低噪声场景提供更好的偏差-方差权衡。两方法均能显著减少计算资源并支持分位数回归，适合i.i.d.表格数据。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

### [8] [Differential Privacy: Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23931)
*Miguel Fernandez-de-Retana,Unai Zulaika,Rubén Sánchez-Corcuera,Aitor Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD能有效缓解梯度重构攻击（有精度代价），PDP-SGD保精度但不防重构，需在联邦学习中实证评估隐私机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然不共享原始数据，但共享的梯度仍可被用于重构敏感信息。尽管理论上差分隐私能保护隐私，需在实际分布式设置中验证其对梯度泄露攻击的实效性。

Method: 作者在模拟联邦学习环境中，对比了DP-SGD与PDP-SGD两种差分隐私机制。在不同隐私强度（噪声和裁剪参数）下训练多种计算机视觉分类模型，随后针对截获的梯度执行重构攻击以评估隐私泄露程度。

Result: 实验表明：1）DP-SGD在多数设置下能显著降低重构图像质量，减轻信息泄露风险，但会导致一定的精度下降；2）PDP-SGD在保持模型精度方面表现更好，但并未有效阻止基于梯度的重构攻击；3）需要在隐私保护和模型效用之间做权衡，并强调了对实用攻击的经验评估。

Conclusion: 本文结论是：DP-SGD在联邦学习场景下能显著降低梯度泄露攻击效果，但代价是适度的模型性能下降；而基于显式正则化的PDP-SGD在保持较好分类性能的同时，对抵御重构攻击实用性不足。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

### [9] [From Detection to Discovery: A Closed-Loop Approach for Simultaneous and Continuous Medical Knowledge Expansion and Depression Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23626)
*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，将抑郁预测与知识扩展迭代结合，实现预测性能与医学知识共同演进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅利用医学知识改进预测，却未利用预测过程去扩展医学知识；希望构建一个能在预测与知识扩展间循环增益的体系

Method: Closed-Loop LLM-KG framework

Result: 在大型UGC数据上，框架同时提升抑郁检测准确率并发现新的临床相关实体（症状、共病、社会触发因素），专家评估证实其临床意义

Conclusion: 通过“prediction-through-learning”和“learning-through-prediction”的互促机制，框架推动模型与领域知识共进，为动态风险监测的自适应知识系统提供基础

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

### [10] [SPEAR++: Scaling Gradient Inversion via Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24200)
*Alexander Bakarsky,Dimitar I. Dimitrov,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR++通过将稀疏字典学习引入SPEAR攻击，使针对带ReLU线性层的梯度反演在计算上可行，显著提高了可处理的批量大小（约10倍），并保持对DP噪声和FedAvg的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在解决联邦学习中基于梯度反演攻击的隐私风险评估困难，特别是当前SPEAR方法对批量大小呈指数级时间复杂度导致实用性受限的问题。作者希望通过引入稀疏字典学习领域的先进技术，使针对带ReLU激活的线性层的梯度反演攻击在更大批量下也能高效运行，从而提供可扩展并具有理论支撑的隐私攻击工具。

Method: 在原SPEAR基于梯度解析的框架上，采用稀疏字典学习（Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning）技术来构造和求解稀疏编码问题，减少对批量大小的指数级枚举，结合优化与启发式策略提升可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Result: 提出了SPEAR++攻击算法，将稀疏字典学习技术应用到SPEAR框架，从而将原本对批量大小指数级增长的计算复杂度显著降低，使得攻击可扩展到大约10倍更大的批量。实验显示SPEAR++保留了SPEAR对差分隐私噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPEAR++填补了SPEAR在实用性方面的空白，证明了理论攻击可以通过稀疏表示方法在实际联邦学习设置中高效运行，从而对部署系统提出更实际的隐私威胁评估需求。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

*Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Keqin Bao,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile 用2.6M条代码执行到分步推理的转换语料（CoE）训练 LLM，显著提升数学与算法类推理能力，效果在多模型多基准上稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码包含丰富的逻辑结构与多样推理范式，但原始代码中的隐式推理与实现噪声限制了直接训练效果，需将隐含的执行步骤显式化以促进模型学习推理流程。

Method: 构建大规模 CoE 语料：将代码执行轨迹转成逐步推理链，包含变量跟踪问题与代码重写以增强逻辑粒度和多样性；在四个基础模型上进行继续预训练、指令微调与两阶段微调评估。

Result: 在20个基准（数学、代码、逻辑、算法）上均观察到一致提升；LLaMA3.1-8B 在九个数学数据集平均提高7.1%，在 LiveCodeBench、CRUX、MMLU 等基准上通过两阶段微调也有明显增益。

Conclusion: TracePile 将代码执行转换为显式分步推理（Chain of Execution, CoE），通过2.6M样本的语料提升 LLM 在数学、算法与代码理解任务上的推理能力，三种训练方式均表现稳健，尤其对 LLaMA3.1-8B 在数学数据集有显著提升。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

### [12] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper examines trade-off between personalization and generalization in FL, evaluates models at multiple stages per round, and introduces FLIU—an easy individualized extension to FedAvg improving robustness under heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning suffers from client drift in heterogeneous data; personalization focuses only on local performance and neglects generalization/out-of-distribution robustness.

Method: Evaluation and proposal of FLIU

Result: Thorough evaluation across stages within a communication round; propose FLIU (FedAvg + individualized update with adaptive personalization); empirical comparisons on MNIST/CIFAR-10 under IID, non-IID, and Dirichlet distributions.

Conclusion: FLIU with adaptive personalization better balances local performance and OOD generalization across various heterogeneity settings; staging evaluations reveal nuances missed by single-metric assessments.

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 本文提出将数值时间序列映射为可解释的结构化事件（number-to-event reasoning），设计了一个包含代理引导事件提取器（AGE）、基于标记多变量霍克斯过程的合成生成器（EveDTS）和两阶段微调的推理感知框架。模型对数值变化进行显式推理，生成中间解释并输出事件假设，在多领域数据集上在事件级精确率和召回率上显著优于强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在多模态推理上表现很好，但对纯数值时间序列的理解有限，现有方法侧重于预测或描述趋势，缺乏发现驱动数值变化的潜在事件与解释其推理过程的能力。需要一种能将数值变化映射为可解释事件的机制。

Method: 提出了一个由三部分组成的框架：1) 代理引导事件提取器（AGE）用于从数值序列中提取潜在事件候选并生成解释性提示；2) EveDTS——基于标记多变量霍克斯过程的合成数据生成器，用于缓解数据稀缺并提高语义对齐；3) 两阶段微调流程，将时间序列编码器与结构化解码器结合，先训练数值推理能力再精调事件解码。模型显式生成中间推理过程并输出结构化事件。

Result: 在多领域数据集上，所提方法在事件级精确率和召回率上明显优于强LLM基线，表明其在解释和预测数值驱动事件方面更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为桥接定量推理与语义理解提供了新方向，使LLM能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测驱动事件，并在多领域实验中取得了更高的事件识别性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

### [14] [Beyond Pairwise: Empowering LLM Alignment With Ranked Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23631)
*Yuxuan Tang,Yifan Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCPO 是一个将偏好优化与排名选择模型结合的统一框架，可以直接利用多项比较与 top-k 排序数据进行对齐训练，实验证明比传统成对方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在利用更丰富的人类反馈形式（多项比较、top-k 排序）改进大模型（LLMs）的对齐方法，弥补传统成对偏好优化忽视排序信息的缺陷。

Method: 通过最大似然估计将偏好学习问题表述为选择模型训练，支持效用型（如 Multinomial Logit）和基于秩的模型（如 Mallows-RMJ），并将若干现有成对方法作为特例，设计相应训练目标用于不同反馈格式。

Result: 提出了 Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO) 框架，将偏好优化与（排序）选择模型通过最大似然估计统一起来；RCPO 支持效用型与基于秩的选择模型，包含 Multinomial Logit 与 Mallows-RMJ 两种实例，并在 Llama-3-8B-Instruct 和 Gemma-2-9B-it 上的 AlpacaEval 2 与 Arena-Hard 基准上优于对比方法。

Conclusion: 直接利用排序偏好数据并选用合适的选择模型能更有效地对齐 LLM；RCPO 提供了一个灵活可扩展的基础，可将（排名）选择建模纳入 LLM 训练。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

TL;DR: 提出基于解码器型大模型的有损科学数据压缩方法LLMCOMP，通过离散化、Z曲线重排和自回归Transformer实现，在严格误差约束下对再分析数据集压缩比较现有方法提升可达30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生的大规模时空数据的高效有界误差压缩问题，利用解码器型大语言模型在复杂序列建模方面的优势，提出通用压缩范式。

Method: 量化3D字段为离散token；按Z-order重排保存空间邻近性；覆盖引导采样（coverage-guided sampling）加速训练数据选择；训练带时空嵌入的自回归Transformer；压缩时用top-k预测只存秩序索引并用回退修正保证误差界；在多组再分析数据集上实验比较。

Result: 提出LLMCOMP：将3D场量化为离散token、用Z曲线保存局部性、覆盖引导采样提升训练效率、用自回归Transformer建模时空嵌入。在压缩时用top-k预测仅存储秩索引并辅以回退校正以保证严格误差上界。

Conclusion: 解码器型LLMs可以作为高精度科学数据的通用压缩器，在保持严格误差界限下显著提高压缩效率，展示了将序列建模能力应用于科学数据压缩的可行性与潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

TL;DR: 提出Noise Combination Sampling（噪声组合采样）方法，在扩散模型去噪过程中从噪声子空间合成最优噪声向量以近似测量分数，将其替换标准DDPM的噪声项，从而在不需逐步调参下将观测信息自然嵌入生成流程。适用于多种逆问题，尤其在步数少时提升性能、稳定性和鲁棒性，计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用预训练扩散模型做零样本逆问题求解时，如何将观测信息融入生成过程：过度融入会破坏生成过程，融入不足则无法满足逆问题约束，当前方法需要逐步调参，缺乏稳健性和通用性。

Method: 定义一个噪声子空间并在该子空间内搜索或合成一个最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，将该向量替换标准DDPM流程中的噪声项，从而在每一步自然引入条件信息。该方法避免了过度或不足整合观测信息的困境，无需逐步调参。

Result: 在多种逆问题（包括图像压缩）上验证，特别是在生成步数T较少时，Noise Combination Sampling显著提高性能，同时几乎不增加计算开销，提升了鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling能在不依赖步级超参数调节的情况下，把观测约束有效地融入扩散模型生成过程，提升在小步数下的逆问题求解性能、稳定性与鲁棒性，适用范围广泛且计算成本低。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper defines MAS functions that encode set inclusion via vector order, gives theoretical limits (no MAS for infinite ground sets), proposes a weakly MAS Hölder-stable model, proves universality for monotone functions, and demonstrates empirical gains on containment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design set-to-vector functions preserving set partial order to solve set containment problems and provide inductive bias for models handling set inclusion.

Method: The paper provides lower/upper bounds on embedding dimension, proves impossibility for infinite ground sets, constructs a ‘weakly MAS’ Hölder-continuous model, and uses MAS embeddings to create universal monotone approximators; experiments compare models on set containment datasets.

Result: Introduces Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions; proves nonexistence for infinite ground sets, introduces a ‘weakly MAS’ model stable under Hölder continuity; shows MAS can build universal monotone models approximating all monotone set functions; empirical results favor proposed model on containment tasks; code released.

Conclusion: Finite-ground MAS embeddings possible with dimension bounds; no exact MAS for infinite ground sets but a practically useful weakly MAS continuous model exists; MAS embeddings enable universal monotone models and improve performance on containment tasks.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在4周的iLog真实用户实验中，SKEL在降低标注劳动与改善数据质量上表现良好，但需更精细的用户确认策略来平衡用户负担与标注准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到个人助手和生活管理应用高度依赖高质量标签，而用户生成或被动收集的注释常含噪声，研究旨在测试SKEL在现实场景中通过与用户交互来提高标注准确性与降低标注负担的可行性。

Method: 在移动应用iLog上进行为期四周的实地用户实验，招募大学生作为参与者，收集其传感器被动数据与主动注释，并允许用户对系统推断的标签进行实时修正，以评估SKEL在真实环境下的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，SKEL可显著减少用户主动注释的工作量并提升整体标签质量，但效果随用户确认率、任务复杂度与界面交互设计变化而波动；同时发现需要在用户投入（耗时/频率）与数据质量之间做权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，在真实用户环境中，Skeptical Learning (SKEL) 能在降低标注成本的同时提升数据质量，但其效果依赖于用户参与度与标注确认机制的设计。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce flight delays and improve air traffic management by predicting delays with contextual multimodal data.

Method: Adapt trajectory representations into language modality, fuse with textual flight info, weather, and notices, and use a lightweight LLM to produce real-time delay predictions.

Result: A lightweight LLM-based multimodal model integrating trajectory data converted to language modality plus textual aeronautical information achieves sub-minute prediction error and supports real-time updates.

Conclusion: Combining linguistic understanding with cross-modality trajectory adaptation improves delay prediction accuracy and is practical for operational deployment.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Conclusion: 在大规模形式化库中，融合依赖关系的图增强方法能显著提升前提选择效果，优于仅基于语言的方法。

Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large
formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in
isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a
graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean
formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph
capturing both state--premise and premise--premise relations. On the LeanDojo
Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over
25% across standard retrieval metrics. These results demonstrate the power of
relational information for more effective premise selection.

Motivation: 现有多模态分子模型受3D构型不可靠和模态间融合导致的信息丢失限制，需一种既稳健又能保留模态特性的融合策略。

Method: 设计了结构化融合管道（SFP）用于合并2D与3D信息以构建稳定先验；采用渐进注入（PI）机制非对称地将先验融合入序列流；采用状态空间网络作为骨干以支持长程建模。

Result: MuMo提出了一种结构化多模态融合框架，旨在解决分子建模中3D共形体不可靠性和模态崩塌问题。通过结构化融合管道（SFP）将2D拓扑和3D几何整合为稳定的结构先验，并通过渐进注入（PI）机制将该先验非对称地注入序列流，以保持模态特有建模同时实现跨模态增强。基于状态空间骨干网络，支持长距离依赖和鲁棒的信息传播。在TDC和MoleculeNet的29个基准任务上平均优于最佳基线2.7%，在22个任务上排名第一。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

TL;DR: 提出SAL-T：将基于运动学的空间分区和局部卷积整合进线性Transformer，显著降低推理资源与延迟，同时保持或接近全注意力性能，适用于高能物理和点云分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全注意力Transformer在高能物理数据（大量粒子点云）上效果好但推理时资源和延迟高；需要一种能保留性能同时降低计算/内存开销、适用于LHC等高吞吐场景的方法。

Method: 在Linformer框架上引入基于粒子动学特征（如角度、能量等）的空间感知分区，对区域间进行线性注意力计算；并在分区内或邻近区域加入卷积层以捕获局部相关性，结合物理直觉（喷注物理）设计网络结构和特征编码。

Result: 在喷注分类任务上，SAL-T优于标准Linformer，并在资源与延迟显著降低的情况下达到与全注意力Transformer接近的分类性能；在ModelNet10点云分类上也验证了相同趋势。提供了代码仓库。

Conclusion: SAL-T在保持线性注意力复杂度的同时，通过基于运动学特征的空间感知分区与卷积层补充局部相关性，能在资源受限场景下接近全注意力Transformer的性能，并优于标准Linformer。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRQK通过在prefill时对Q和K做低秩分解并在decode时基于低维投影快速筛选top-k和近期tokens，只在缺失时从CPU传输全精度KV，实现长上下文下的显著内存与带宽节约且几乎不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当输入长度增长时，KV缓存的GPU内存与CPU-GPU传输成为限制长上下文推理的瓶颈。现有量化或剪枝方法存在数值精度损失或选择子集不理想的问题，因而需要一种既能节约内存又能保持注意力精确性的方案。

Method: 两阶段：1) Prefill阶段对全精度Q和K做联合低秩分解，得到rank-r因子并存储低维投影；2) Decode阶段使用低秩投影以O(lr)复杂度计算代理注意分数以筛选top-k tokens并结合固定数量的近期tokens；采用混合GPU-CPU缓存，遇到miss再按需从CPU传输完整KV以保持精确注意力。

Result: 提出了一种称为LRQK的两阶段框架，在预填充阶段将查询（Q）和键（K）矩阵分解为低秩因子，并在解码阶段用低维投影计算代理注意分数，从而显著降低KV缓存的GPU内存开销并减少CPU-GPU的数据传输，同时保持精确的注意力输出。

Conclusion: LRQK在RULER和LongBench上对LLaMA-3-8B与Qwen2.5-7B做验证，能在长上下文场景下匹配或优于现有稀疏注意方法，同时带来显著内存节约与极小准确性损失。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Motivation: Edge devices cannot run large LLMs due to size and compute; need pruning to reduce cost, but existing layer pruning ignores inter-layer dependencies leading to degraded performance.

Method: 使用可微分凹门控算法进行梯度优化以识别最佳连续层段；采用cutoff endpoint tuning策略只微调被剪切段相邻的层以恢复性能；在多模型多尺度上评估并与量化结合。

Result: CLP, a continuous layer pruning framework with a differentiable concave gate to identify prune segments via gradients and a cutoff endpoint tuning strategy to fine-tune adjacent layers. Achieves strong retention across LLaMA2/3 and Qwen, e.g., 95.34% retention at 20% pruning on LLaMA3-70B, outperforms baselines, and compatible with quantization.

Conclusion: CLP effectively prunes continuous layer segments while preserving performance via gradient-based selection and localized finetuning; it's broadly applicable across large LLMs and compatible with quantization.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

TL;DR: 提出SAEA：将预测误差建模为时空VAR过程，通过系数矩阵与稀疏正则化嵌入训练，并在测试时动态校正误差，从而提升交通预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用MSE训练假设误差独立，但交通数据呈显著时空自相关，忽略此点限制了DNN预测性能，需对误差自相关建模与校正。

Method: 1) 将预测误差建模为时空VAR过程；2) 学习误差系数矩阵并将其嵌入新的损失函数；3) 用结构稀疏正则化结合路网先验；4) 在推理时进行动态误差调整（测试时校正）。

Result: The paper proposes SAEA, a framework that models DNN forecasting residuals as a spatiotemporal VAR process, embeds the learned coefficient matrix into training via a new loss, uses structured sparse regularization aligned with road networks, and applies test-time error adjustment inference. It improves various traffic forecasting models across datasets.

Conclusion: 将误差的时空自相关建模并在训练与推理阶段校正，能有效提升DNN交通预测模型的准确性并与路网先验对齐。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Conclusion: 结合量子启发方法与经典架构的混合对抗框架，在提高预测性能的同时增强可解释性，并通过实验显示Vanilla模型表现最稳定；该方向有望推动QML在实际任务中的应用

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum

evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First ML framework predicting germination uplift from DBD cold plasma; Extra Trees best; hormesis with optimal 7–15 kV and 200–500 s; power >=100 W beneficial; species/cultivar variation; integrated into MLflow for decision support


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predict and optimize cold plasma treatment effects on seed germination across species and cultivars where outcomes are hard to predict due to complex interactions

Method: Machine learning + engineering analysis

Result: Extra Trees model achieved best performance (R^2=0.919, RMSE=3.21, MAE=2.62), improved to R^2=0.925 after feature reduction; identified hormetic response and key variables like discharge power

Conclusion: ML model (ET) successfully predicts germination uplift and provides a decision-support tool; feature reduction improves performance; treatment windows and dominant factors identified, enabling precision optimization

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出ELBO-KTO：用ELBO替代扩散对数似然并结合KTO无配对偏好优化，在自动Judge评测下显著提升了LLaDA-8B-Instruct的相对胜率，同时在下游任务上保持或提升性能，证明了对扩散LLM进行无配对偏好优化的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型的序列对数似然不可易得，而配对偏好数据昂贵；因而需要一种能在无配对偏好数据下对齐dLLMs且可计算近似对数似然的可行方法，从而降低数据与计算成本并使得dLLMs能更好地满足人类偏好。

Method: 用ELBO作为扩散模型的对数似然近似，并结合Kahneman-Tversky Optimization（KTO）的无配对前景理论式偏好目标；分析ELBO替代引入的偏差/方差，采用方差减少与梯度稳定化实践来训练；在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上用kto-mix-14k与UltraFeedback-Binary数据集训练并用自动LLM判官评估胜率与下游任务表现。

Result: ELBO-KTO是一种用于扩散语言模型（dLLMs）的人类偏好对齐方法，结合了ELBO替代项与基于前景理论的无配对偏好目标（KTO），并在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: ELBO替代会引入偏差与方差，但通过方差减小技巧和稳定化训练可有效控制；ELBO-KTO能在无配对偏好数据下显著提升扩散LLM的对齐表现，并在多项任务上与基线持平或更优，表明无配对偏好优化是对抗昂贵成对偏好数据的一种可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Motivation: Classical ML/DL struggle with high-dimensional complex image data; quantum computing may improve classification efficiency for potato disease detection.

Method: Hybrid QML with ResNet-50 + QSVM

Result: Using ResNet-50 features reduced by PCA and classified by QSVM with Z-feature map achieved 99.23% accuracy, outperforming classical SVM and RF under five-fold stratified CV.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical pipeline shows promise for image-based disease detection; Z-feature map QSVM outperforms classical baselines in this study.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

TL;DR: ST-ViWT combines wavelet time-frequency features with transformer attention over meteorology and land data to gap-fill OCO-2 XCO2, producing continuous 0.25° maps with uncertainties and demonstrating good generalization and correlation with poultry facility density.


<details>

Motivation: Need for accurate, continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 maps over agricultural/poultry-intensive regions to guide emission mitigation and verify interventions.

Method: Fusion of wavelet time-frequency representations and transformer attention applied to multi-source inputs (meteorology, vegetation indices, topography, land cover) to gap-fill OCO-2 XCO2; validation against TCCON and regional spatial analysis.

Result: High-fidelity reconstruction of XCO2 fields over southern Canada, achieving R2 0.984 and RMSE 0.468 ppm with uncertainty quantification and strong TCCON validation.

Conclusion: ST-ViWT reliably reconstructs year-round XCO2 fields, offers explicit uncertainties, outperforms conventional baselines, and is useful for integrating satellite data with inventories to prioritize mitigation and verify interventions.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Method: 构建针对压缩文件固有字节流结构的分词与编码方法，将压缩数据映射为紧凑的token序列，输入常规模型（Transformer）学习语义表示，省去完整解码或原始字节级别处理。

Result: 在多种数据集、编码方案和模态上进行实验，TEMPEST 在准确率上与最先进方法相当，同时在内存和计算效率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEMPEST 提出了一种直接从压缩数据流学习语义表示的新方法，通过设计面向压缩字节流的分词和编码策略，使标准Transformer能在不解码或逐字节处理原始数据的情况下进行语义分类。

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

TL;DR: MoEs differ from dense nets: network sparsity—not feature sparsity/importance—drives monosemantic representations across experts; new metrics and a redefined specialization show sparse MoEs are more interpretable without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand mechanistic differences between MoE and dense models, especially superposition and interpretability.

Method: Analysis of methods

Result: Network sparsity (ratio of active to total experts) better characterizes MoE behavior; greater sparsity leads to monosemanticity; experts specialize into coherent feature combinations when initialized appropriately.

Conclusion: Network sparsity enables more interpretable expert specialization in MoEs via monosemantic feature representation, challenging the trade-off between interpretability and capability.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

TL;DR: 提出HIPE方法，通过信息论原则在初始化中平衡减少预测不确定性与学习超参数，针对GP模型给出闭式表达，并在主动学习与少样本BO中验证优于随机设计，尤其在大批次少样本场景效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于信息理论构建的采集函数，兼顾减少预测不确定性与获取关于GP超参数的信息；对高斯过程推导出闭式采集函数表达，并在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示HIPE在预测误差、超参数识别率和优化目标值上均优于（拟）随机初始策略，尤其在大批量、少轮次评估情境下提升明显。

Conclusion: HIPE能在少样本、大批量设置下提高预测精度、超参数识别及随后的优化表现，优于标准（拟）随机初始化策略。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera combines LLM strategist, verified symbolic constraint engine, and causal counterfactual module to achieve prompt-agnostic, high-return, trust-preserving decisions in e-commerce; verified safe and reproducible


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate catastrophic brittleness of LLM agents due to prompt framing and ensure safe, robust decisions in high-stakes deployment

Method: Neuro-symbolic-causal architecture with LLM + symbolic constraints + causal module

Result: Chimera outperforms LLM-only and LLM+constraints across 52-week e-commerce simulations, yielding higher profit and improved brand trust; TLA+ verifies zero constraint violations

Conclusion: Architectural design (neuro-symbolic-causal) is crucial for reliable autonomous agents; Chimera provides robust, verifiable performance improvements over baselines and is reproducible with open-source code.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出一个并行混合模型（Transformer + BiLSTM），Transformer 捕捉长程依赖，BiLSTM 抽取局部时序特征，两分支特征在融合层合并，用于 Lorenz 系统的两项任务：自主演化预测与未观测变量推断，结果优于单一分支模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统既有局部复杂非线性又有全局长期依赖，单一模型难以同时捕捉两者；因此提出将 Transformer 的长程建模能力与 BiLSTM 的局部时序能力并行融合以提高 chaotic 时间序列预测与状态重建性能。

Method: 构建双分支并行网络：一分支为 Transformer（长程依赖建模），另一分支为 BiLSTM（局部时序特征提取）；两分支输出在特征融合层合并，随后用于递归预测（用于自主演化）或用于直接回归未观测变量（用于状态推断）；训练使用延迟嵌入的时间序列数据，评估指标包括长期跟踪精度与稳定性、重构误差等。

Result: 在 Lorenz 系统的两项任务上，混合模型在长期预测精度、稳定性和未观测变量重构误差方面均优于单分支 Transformer 或 BiLSTM，显示出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 并行 Transformer–BiLSTM 混合框架在 Lorenz 系统的长期轨迹预测和部分观测状态重建任务中均优于单一模型，显示出更好的准确性与稳定性，具有较强的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of
discriminatory effects. The contributions in this thesis enable more
appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUStReason benchmark and PragCoT method help VideoLMs better detect sarcasm by focusing on implied intentions using annotated cues and disentangled perception/reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study limitations of VideoLMs in sarcasm detection and provide diagnostic benchmark and method.

Method: Created diagnostic benchmark MUStReason with annotations, evaluated VideoLMs on perception vs reasoning, and proposed PragCoT to steer models toward pragmatic reasoning.

Result: Introduced MUStReason dataset with modality-specific cue annotations and PragCoT framework to improve reasoning and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: MUStReason reveals VideoLMs struggle with sarcasm; PragCoT improves focus on intended meaning and aids classification and reasoning.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

TL;DR: 建立可识别性理论并用变分推断恢复非虚假潜变量，从而训练对虚假相关性更鲁棒的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人类反馈的强化学习等对齐方法依赖奖励模型，但这些奖励模型易利用诸如长度、歧视、谄媚等虚假相关性，导致不符合真实偏好的行为；因此需要一种能削弱或消除这些虚假相关性而保留真正偏好的方法。

Method: 构建包含虚假与非虚假潜变量的数据生成模型，给出非虚假潜变量可识别性的理论证明；设计基于变分推断的实际算法用于恢复非虚假潜变量，并将其作为输入训练奖励模型以避免模型利用虚假相关性。

Result: 提出了一种理论和实用相结合的方法来缓解奖励模型中的虚假相关性，同时保留体现期望偏好的潜在因素。作者构建了包含虚假与非虚假潜变量的数据生成过程，证明了非虚假潜变量在理论上可被识别（即使没有虚假变量的代理也可），并基于变分推断提出了可实现的方法。实验证明在合成与真实数据上均能减少虚假关联并提升奖励模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 作者证明并实证了：非虚假潜变量可被识别，基于此可构建变分方法恢复这些变量并训练出在多种虚假相关性（长度、歧视、谄媚、概念偏差）下更鲁棒的奖励模型。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Motivation: 探究是什么机制使Cobweb/4V对灾难性遗忘表现出鲁棒性，从而为构建更稳定的持续学习系统提供设计指引。

Method: 提出CobwebNN作为Cobweb框架的神经实现，并在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST、CIFAR-10上与神经基线比较；通过消融和对比实验检验自适应重组、稀疏更新及信息论学习的贡献。

Result: Cobweb/4V在视觉连续学习任务中显示出对灾难性遗忘的鲁棒性，主要归因于层级结构的自适应重组、稀疏与选择性更新，以及基于充分统计量的信息论学习过程。这些机制在不同复杂度的数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST、CIFAR-10）上的实验支持了三个假设：自适应结构提升可塑性，稀疏更新减轻干扰，信息论学习在无需重访旧数据的情况下能保留先前知识。

Conclusion: 基于概念的层级结构、自适应重组和信息论学习构成了一条有前景的路径，可在不回放旧数据的前提下构建稳定且适应性的持续学习系统。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

TL;DR: RSS是一种在连续logit空间上的MCMC方法，通过将结构预测（AlphaFold2）和序列先验（ESM2）耦合，显著提升蛋白设计的可设计性与多样性，优于传统的RSO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结构预测的蛋白质设计方法（如AlphaFold2）在效果上有显著进展，但现有方法如放松序列优化（RSO）依赖单路径梯度下降且忽视序列空间约束，导致设计多样性和可设计性受限。作者提出一种新的MCMC框架，结合结构与进化信息以改进设计探索。

Method: 在连续logit空间构建马尔可夫链：结合基于梯度的局部移动（利用AlphaFold2结构目标的梯度）和基于蛋白语言模型的全局跳跃（用ESM2估计的序列先验），并用一个耦合的能量函数平衡结构相符性与序列合理性，从而执行采样生成多样化且可设计的序列。

Result: 提出了Relaxed Sequence Sampling（RSS），在连续logit空间中运行，结合梯度引导的局部探索与蛋白语言模型（如ESM2）驱动的跳跃，能量函数将AlphaFold2派生的结构目标与ESM2的序列先验耦合。在体外的蛋白结合子设计任务中，RSS在相同计算成本下比RSO基线产生5倍更多可设计结构和2-3倍更大的结构多样性。

Conclusion: RSS为蛋白质设计提供了一种有原则的、计算高效的探索手段，能在保持结构准确性的同时提高生物学可行性和设计多样性，有望改进基于结构的设计流程。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集合预报受计算成本和对大气非线性表示能力的限制，需要更有效的集合生成方法以量化不确定性并提高极端天气预报精度。

Method: 该研究将基于学习的扰动方案（learnable perturbation）用于集合生成，系统性对比了FuXi-ENS与传统数值集合（ECMWF-ENS）在2018年全球90个热带气旋的表现，分析变量包括路径、强度、动力和热力场。

Result: FuXi-ENS在TC相关物理变量和路径预报上显示明显优势，集合离散度更小且路径更精确；然而对风速强度的偏低估计仍存在。动力热力分析显示FuXi-ENS在大尺度环流和暖芯湿度能量集中上表现更好。

Conclusion: FuXi-ENS在多个TC相关物理量和路径预报上优于ECMWF-ENS，能更好捕捉大尺度环流与湿度能量分布，但对强度的估计仍偏弱。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

TL;DR: 本文提出将稀疏自编码器(SAE)训练于音频自动编码器的潜在向量上，并通过线性映射将SAE特征与离散化声学属性（音高、响度、音色）对齐，以实现可控生成与解释性分析。验证对象包括连续与离散潜在空间（DiffRhythm-VAE、EnCodec、WavTokenizer），并在DiffRhythm的文本到音乐生成流程中追踪声学属性如何随合成过程演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频潜在空间通常密集且难以直接解释，且自动化的特征表征能力有限。为实现对AI音乐生成过程的可控与可解释，需要把潜在表示映射到人类可理解的声学属性。

Method: 先对音频自动编码器的潜在向量训练稀疏自编码器，得到稀疏可解释特征；再将这些特征通过线性映射（分类或回归）对齐到离散化的声学属性（音高、响度、音色）；最后通过对潜在向量的操纵验证控制效果，并在生成模型（如DiffRhythm）中追踪属性随时间变化。

Result: 在连续（DiffRhythm-VAE）与离散（EnCodec、WavTokenizer）潜在空间上均能学到与音高、响度、音色相关的稀疏特征，支持线性映射到离散属性并实现可控操纵。对DiffRhythm的分析展示了这些声学属性在生成过程中的演化路径。

Conclusion: 在音频生成模型中，SAE可将抽象潜在表示映射到人类可理解的声学概念，从而实现可控操作与解释性分析，揭示音高、音色和响度如何在合成过程中生成和演化。该框架在不同潜在空间上均有效，且可扩展到视觉等其它模态。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam's coordinate-wise scaling induces rotation sensitivity that can eliminate its richness bias; applying an orthogonal reparameterization makes first-order methods rotation-equivariant and restores Adam's nonlinear decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how adaptive methods' coordinate-wise scaling affects generalization compared to gradient descent, and why Adam sometimes has a richness bias but can lose it under rotations.

Method: The paper analyzes Adam's sensitivity to orthogonal transformations theoretically and empirically; shows small rotations can change learned boundary from rich nonlinear to linear; applies a reparameterization (orthogonal transformation of objective) to make methods rotation-equivariant and tests empirically.

Result: Finds that Adam can forfeit its richness bias under small rotations and perform worse than GD; reparameterization fixes equivariance and empirically restores Adam's advantage.

Conclusion: Adam's coordinate-wise preconditioning makes it sensitive to rotations; this can reverse its richness bias causing worse generalization than GD; reparameterization with orthogonal transforms restores rotation equivariance and recovers Adam's richness bias.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on scarce high-fidelity paired data and handle unevenly discretized inputs across samples.

Method: Paper proposes physics-informed, data-free operator learning by extending RINO to handle multi-resolution inputs using pre-trained basis and an MLP approximating PDE operator; finite difference enforces PDEs.

Result: Method validated on numerical benchmarks with multi-resolution inputs; shows capability to learn operators without training data by enforcing PDE via FD solver and using latent embeddings from pre-trained bases.

Conclusion: Framework can approximate PDE operators without paired training data and handle varying input discretizations, enabling operator learning in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Motivation: 工业过程数据复杂且模型结果往往不可解释，研究旨在提高检测性能同时提供可操作的解释，帮助操作者理解故障机制。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过循环累积并按列缩放低秩增量，构建高秩权重更新，从而在效果与收敛速度上优于常规LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA限制：低秩限制可能降低效能并放慢收敛，通过构造高秩更新尝试兼顾参数效率与表达能力。

Method: 每次计算对损失最优的低秩矩阵更新，解析得到列缩放系数，用于调整并累积低秩增量形成高秩更新，保持优化流程连续无需重启。

Result: 提出了一种从连续低秩增量累积形成高秩权重更新的方法，以在保持LoRA高效性的同时提升效果与收敛速度。通过对每次更新找到最优低秩矩阵并通过缩放列来近似全量微调，给出解析的最优缩放因子，支持无缝优化。实验证明在最多12B参数的LLM上在多任务上优于现有LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 适当缩放低秩更新的列并累积可在不重启训练的情况下近似全量微调，带来一致且显著的性能提升与更快收敛。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

*Paul Rosu,Muchang Bahng,Erick Jiang,Rico Zhu,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文在潜变量扩散用于气候下采样的框架中加入像素空间PDE损失（基于有限差分的平流-扩散项），以增强物理一致性；实验证明常规训练已表现良好，PDE微调能带来额外正则化和物理性提升，但改进有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大气动力学下采样任务中，期望生成的高分辨率温度场不仅视觉上逼近真实数据，还需满足物理守恒与动力学约束，因此在生成模型中引入物理损失以提高物理可接受性。

Method: 在现有的潜变量扩散架构上，以对参考UNet的残差形式工作，训练目标中加入在解码后像素空间计算的PDE损失，该损失通过有限差分近似有效平流-扩散平衡项来衡量物理一致性。

Result: 实验表明，常规扩散训练已经产生较低的PDE残差；在此基础上微调并加入PDE损失可以进一步正则化模型，提高生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 本文提出在扩散模型训练中加入PDE损失，能进一步提升生成气温场的物理一致性，但传统扩散训练已能得到较低的PDE残差，因此改进幅度有限。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT通过归一化并最小化隐式显式奖励差异，将复杂的在线RL对齐问题转为稳定的MSE优化，兼顾探索与稳定性，并提升泛化与收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式奖励方法在训练不稳定和探索受限的问题，同时保留在线策略优化的探索能力，并减少超参数与过拟合。

Method: 分析方法与创新点

Result: 提出GIFT框架，通过对隐式与显式奖励进行归一化并以均方误差对齐，从非凸的奖励优化转为凸稳定的优化，实验证明在数学推理与对齐任务上表现更优且计算高效。

Conclusion: GIFT将在线多响应生成、隐式奖励与隐式-显式对齐三者结合，提供一种在保留探索的同时提高稳定性和泛化性的LLM对齐方法，实验证据支持其优越性。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address predictive maintenance challenges for electric buses by leveraging CAN Bus data to predict alarms and enable proactive maintenance.

Method: 数据经详尽预处理后，先用Pearson、Cramer's V、ANOVA F-test做统计过滤，再用InfoMap、Leiden、Louvain、Fast Greedy等社区检测进行图谱优化的特征选择；模型训练用网格/随机搜索调参，并用SMOTEEN和二分法下采样处理类别不平衡；最后用LIME做局部可解释性分析。

Result: Developed a hybrid graph-based feature selection combining statistical filters and community detection; trained optimized ML models (SVM, RF, XGBoost) with balancing; used LIME for interpretability; system effectively predicts alarms and supports PdM.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能从多维CAN总线数据中筛选关键特征、构建可解释的故障预测模型，提升电动公交的预测维护能力，符合工业4.0要求。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RS-ORT的专用分支定界算法，用于训练最优回归树，避免对连续特征进行简单二值化，能在样本规模大时保持可解性并保证收敛；通过封闭形式叶预测、经验阈值离散化和深度1子树解析等界紧缩技巧以及分解上下界加速训练；支持节点并行，从而在百万级样本上仍能在数小时内得到有保证的训练结果且泛化性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MIP的回归树方法在遇到连续或大规模数据时不可扩展，简单对连续特征二值化既损失全局最优性又导致树深度过大，需要一种既能保证最优性又可扩展到百万级样本及连续特征的训练方法。

Method: 将最优回归树训练重写为两阶段优化问题，仅对树结构变量分支的专用分支定界算法（RS-ORT）；引入闭式叶值预测、经验阈值离散化、深度-1子树精确解析等界紧缩技巧，结合可分解的上/下界策略；节点级别的BB分解利于并行化实现。

Result: 在多项回归基准上，尤其包含连续特征的数据集，RS-ORT在训练/测试性能上优于最先进方法；在最高达200万样本的连续特征数据上，四小时内可得到带有全局性能保证、结构更简单且泛化更好的回归树。

Conclusion: RS-ORT在理论上保证收敛且与训练样本数无关，通过结构化分支和多种界紧缩/分解技巧显著提升了大规模连续特征回归树训练的可扩展性和解质量，在多项基准上优于现有方法，能在四小时内对200万样本得到更简单且泛化更好的最优回归树。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 利用Drift Diffusion模型将反应时间并入偏好学习，构建Neyman-orthogonal损失，实现oracle收敛率，显著提升样本效率并在图像偏好实验中得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于二元偏好的学习忽略了决策时间这一重要信息，导致在奖励幅度较大或样本有限时估计误差和样本需求显著增加。利用反应时间可获取关于偏好强度的额外信息，从而提升奖励模型的学习效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 在二元选择数据基础上，结合Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion（EZ）模型，将反应时间作为偏好强度的信号；构造Neyman-orthogonal损失函数以消除估计偏差，实现与已知期望反应时间情形相同的oracle收敛率；理论证明并推广到非参数情形；在图像偏好学习任务上做大量实验验证。

Result: 理论上：构建的算法在线性奖励下将误差从与奖励幅度呈指数关系降为多项式关系；非参数情形也获得收敛保证。实证上：在图像偏好学习任务中，含反应时间的方法在样本效率和估计精度上均优于仅用二元选择的方法，并与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 本文通过将反应时间引入偏好学习框架，有效提升了奖励模型的学习效率，尤其在奖励幅度较大时显著改善了样本复杂度，从指数级退化降为多项式级别。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Motivation: 解决现有因果发现方法只关注变量对对之间的因果关系，忽略变量组（子系统）及其整体影响的识别问题，尤其在非线性多变量时间序列中

Method: 1) 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组间的结构关系；2) 对训练好的模型实施组级干预（扰动特定变量组或其表示）；3) 通过模型不变性检验（比较干预前后预测分布/性能的显著变化）来判断组间因果连边的存在

Result: 提出gCDMI方法：在训练好的深度神经网络上施加组级干预并结合模型不变性检验，从而识别组级因果关系；在模拟数据和真实数据（脑网络、气候系统）上显示优于现有方法的性能

Conclusion: 在深度学习模型上执行组级干预并利用不变性检测，可有效揭示复杂的组级因果结构，提供比基于成对分析更全面的因果洞见

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

TL;DR: Under assumptions, Query weights are unnecessary; removing them saves >8% parameters and preserves performance on GPT-3 small


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce parameters and simplify attention by testing if Query weights are redundant

Method: Theoretical analysis + empirical verification

Result: Proved Query weights redundant under simplifying assumptions; reduced model (no Query weights) matches validation loss of baseline on GPT-3 small trained from scratch; >8% reduction in non-embedding/lm-head parameters

Conclusion: Query weight redundancy holds in theory and empirically for tested architectures, motivating scale-up investigations.

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify geometric interpretation of MDPs across discounted and average-reward cases to transfer convergence results.

Method: Extend geometric interpretation from discounted to average-reward MDPs and adapt analysis to prove geometric convergence of Value Iteration.

Result: Extended geometric framework to average-reward MDPs and proved Value Iteration has geometric convergence rate under unique ergodic optimal policy.

Conclusion: With a unique, ergodic optimal policy, Value Iteration converges geometrically in average-reward MDPs, matching known discounted-case results.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

*Ningfeng Yang,Tor M. Aamodt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOGZO mixes STE and occasional ZO updates to correct bias, achieving better accuracy/perplexity than STE with much lower cost than pure ZO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE gives biased but cheap gradients; ZO gives unbiased but expensive gradients. Combine strengths to reduce STE bias while lowering ZO cost.

Method: First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (FOGZO)

Result: FOGZO improves accuracy/perplexity vs STE across models (DeiT, ResNet, LLaMA) and greatly reduces computation vs n-SPSA (796x) for small MLP; better quality-training time tradeoff in QAT.

Conclusion: FOGZO offers practical middle ground for quantized training: reduces bias and computation, improving performance in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time, robust ensemble forecasting for high-dimensional flow models without costly paired solution data and with better generalization to 3D flows.

Method: Data-free physics-informed operator network for Navier Stokes

Result: Surpasses prior neural operators in accuracy on 2D benchmarks, provides accurate 3D Navier Stokes solutions for the first time among data-free neural operators, and is more efficient than numerical solvers for ensembles.

Conclusion: Combining numerically grounded architecture with ML scalability produces practical data-free, high-fidelity PDE surrogates for scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

Motivation: 提供一个全面、一致的基准来评估LLM在国际象棋领域的理解能力，弥补现有评估的零散和狭隘性，能随着模型进步动态更新。

Method: 设计五类任务对应棋手逐步掌握的抽象能力，构建可更新的数据集、提示与答案脚本，并在多款当代LLM上运行评测与误差分析，提供代码和排行榜以便后续研究。

Result: 提出ChessQA基准，涵盖结构、兵形动机、短战术、局面判断、语义五类任务，提供脚本、提示和答案可动态刷新，并对多款当代LLM进行评估，发现各类持续弱点，附带类别级误差分析与公开发布计划。

Conclusion: ChessQA能更全面诊断LLM的棋力与理解差距，支持持续更新和社区比较，揭示模型在不同抽象层面上的系统性弱点。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Motivation: 防止训练或架构改变导致失去对链式思考的监控能力，提供可操作的度量与工具以保持监控性。

Method: 定义legibility与coverage指标，设计并分享一个autorater提示以让LLM评估CoT，对合成退化样本进行检验，再在多个前沿模型与基准上应用，输出评分分析。

Result: They propose measures for monitorability: legibility and coverage; implement via autorater prompt enabling LLM to rate CoTs; sanity-checked with synthetic degradations; applied to frontier models showing high monitorability; provide prompt as tool; emphasize complement to adversarial testing.

Conclusion: 所提指标与自动评分提示为保留与跟踪CoT可监控性提供实用工具，当前为初步版本，应结合对抗性压力测试使用。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized
stochastic computers. Despite promising efficiency gains, these proposals have
failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling
techniques and exotic, unscalable hardware. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that
implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level. A system-level
analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately
10,000 times less energy.

Motivation: 固定的文本嵌入无法随扩散过程自适应，限制了文本条件与生成图像之间的一致性与偏好对齐。

Method: 在采样时基于中间扰动图像构建优化问题，推导出一步更新规则用于精炼文本嵌入，并在反向扩散过程中逐步调整文本条件，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: DATE通过在每个扩散时间步动态更新文本嵌入，提高了文本-图像对齐性，同时保持了生成模型的能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型常低估罕见但危害大的污染峰值，需提高对极端污染事件的预测能力以支持及时公共健康预警。

Method: 基于区域适配的 transformer 主干网络，结合基于扩散的随机精化模块；使用 ERA5 与 CAMS 数据的融合输入；采用领域感知目标函数并结合极值理论进行训练。

Result: 在 PM1、PM2.5、PM10 等多种变量上对极端条件下的预测有显著改进，在高度受影响区域表现提升明显且未损害整体精度。

Conclusion: SynCast 显著提升了空气颗粒物浓度的极端值和平均值预测能力，为空气质量预警提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STNet iteratively transforms operator using deflation and spectral filters based on learned approximate eigenpairs, making eigenvalue problems easier and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for operator eigenvalue problems struggle with curse of dimensionality and depend on operator spectral distribution; transforming the operator spectrum can improve convergence and precision.

Method: Spectral Transformation Network (STNet)

Result: STNet uses approximate eigenpairs each iteration to apply deflation projection and filter transforms, shrinking search space and amplifying desired eigenvalues, leading to state-of-the-art accuracy over prior learning-based methods.

Conclusion: STNet effectively leverages spectral transformations (deflation and filtering) to improve neural-network-based eigenvalue solvers, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

### [71] [Optimal Arm Elimination Algorithms for Combinatorial Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23992)
*Yuxiao Wen,Yanjun Han,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种将臂划为confirmed/active/eliminated并引入显式探索的淘汰算法，应用于带一般图反馈的组合多臂和组合线性上下文臂，获得近最优后悔并给出匹配下界，解决了UCB扩展在某些场景探索不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在组合臂设置下，直接推广UCB方法会因缺乏显式探索而在某些实例上失败，尤其是当反馈结构或上下文相关性导致信息无法自然覆盖所有臂时。因而需要一种能够显式控制探索、保证重要臂被区分和淘汰的淘汰式方法。

Method: 设计了一种新的淘汰框架：在每个阶段通过显式探索收集信息，根据置信区间将臂划分为三类（confirmed/active/eliminated），并对active集合进行进一步试验来决定更新。把该框架应用到两类问题中：一是带一般图反馈的组合多臂问题，二是组合线性上下文臂；分别给出算法细节、置信界估计和探索策略，并进行理论分析得到上界。

Result: 提出的算法在两类组合带背景下均获得近最优后悔界（上界），比传统UCB扩展在可构造的困难实例上表现更好；同时证明了匹配的下界，说明算法在渐近意义上是最优的。并通过理论证明展示了显式探索对避免UCB失败的关键性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的臂淘汰（elimination）方案，通过将臂分为“确认（confirmed）”、“活跃（active）”和“淘汰（eliminated）”三类，并引入显式探索步骤来更新这些集合，从而克服了将传统UCB方法直接推广到组合臂问题时的探索不足问题。作者证明了在组合多臂带有一般图反馈和组合线性上下文臂两种场景下，该方法能获得近最优的累积后悔（regret），并给出了相应的下界，表明其渐近最优性。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

TL;DR: Using AIS-derived features and ML (best: Poisson Regressor), the study predicts barge counts with MAE 1.92; maneuverability metrics are most predictive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a scalable method to estimate number of barges in tow on inland waterways using AIS data and machine learning, addressing limitations of current monitoring due to barges being unpropelled.

Method: Manually labeled barges from satellite imagery matched to AIS tracks; 30 AIS features computed; RFE selected top features; trained six regression models and evaluated performance; Poisson Regressor best.

Result: Poisson Regressor achieved best performance with MAE 1.92 barges using 12 selected AIS-derived features; key predictive features include course entropy, speed variability, and trip length.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable method to improve maritime domain awareness and operational planning; future work should test transferability to other rivers.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: STG steers text embeddings at sampling time using a safety score on expected denoised images to reduce harmful outputs without retraining, aligning model distribution to safety constraints with minimal quality loss


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent generation of unsafe or biased content from text-to-image diffusion models without additional training

Method: STG-guidance for diffusion models

Result: A training-free algorithm that adjusts text embeddings during sampling based on a safety function evaluated on expected final denoised image, showing improved safety across nudity/violence/artist-style removal while preserving semantics

Conclusion: STG effectively reduces unsafe content generation compared to baselines, is training-free, theoretically justified, and preserves semantic intent; code released

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉特定功能子网络（分区）之间连通性的时间演化，特别是在路径级别的动态行为，因此提出一种针对分区对之间路径轨迹建模的框架以增强对功能性连接动态性的刻画。

Method: 基于预定义医学静态分区，计算每对功能分区间的连接强度随时间的序列（路径级时间序列），将这些序列输入时序神经网络（可能包括LSTM/Transformer等）进行建模，最后进行预测或下游分类评估，且在三个fMRI公开数据集上与主流动态图学习方法比较。

Result: 在三个公开fMRI数据集上的多项指标（可能包括预测准确率、AUC、重构误差等）超过现有主流方法，表明NeuroPathNet在捕捉分区对间动态连接方面具有优势。

Conclusion: NeuroPathNet能更准确地刻画分区间连接的时间演化特征，从而在动态脑网络分析任务上优于现有方法，具有潜在临床诊断应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种Global-Local Fusion (GLF)采样策略，通过按残差反比缩放的高斯扰动在训练点周围生成新的网格点，实现对高残差区域集中采样同时维持全局覆盖；引入线性轻量代理近似残差分布以降低开销。实验证明在基准PDE上比全局/局部采样更准确高效，适用于复杂高维PDE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局采样虽然稳定但样本昂贵，局部采样高效但可能忽略已学好的区域导致鲁棒性下降，故需一种兼顾稳定性与效率的采样策略。

Method: 对训练点进行基于残差的高斯扰动生成新的collocation点：噪声标准差与点残差成反比，从而在高残差区域生成更多采样；为降低计算成本，用一个轻量线性代理近似全局残差分布来引导采样分布。

Result: 在多种基准PDE上，GLF在误差与训练时间上均优于纯全局与纯局部采样，显示出更高的收敛速度和计算效率。

Conclusion: GLF通过残差自适应采样与残差分布近似，兼顾了全局方法的稳定性与局部细化的效率，显著提升PINNs求解PDE的准确性与计算效率，适合复杂、高维问题。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Motivation: Conventional projection-based methods use fixed statistical metrics and assume single data structure, which limits detection performance on multi-modal or nonlinear data; need flexible, multi-stage framework.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, notably outperforming baselines on Optdigits and Arrhythmia; ablation confirms both kernelization and localization are necessary.

Conclusion: Two-Stage LKPLO effectively addresses limitations of projection-based outlier detection by combining adaptive loss-based scoring with global kernel PCA and local clustering, yielding state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

### [80] [Mitigating Negative Transfer via Reducing Environmental Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24044)
*Hui Sun,Zheng Xie,Hao-Yuan He,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper identifies environmental disagreement from non-causal features as a source of negative transfer in UDA and proposes RED, an adversarial disentanglement method to estimate and reduce this disagreement, improving transfer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large domain shifts cause models to rely on non-causal environmental features, producing discriminative disagreement across domains that leads to negative transfer; need to disentangle causal features and suppress harmful environmental features.

Method: Disentangle causal vs non-causal features and reduce environmental disagreement using adversarial training

Result: Proposed RED method: adversarially train domain-specific environmental extractors in opposite domains to disentangle causal/non-causal features, estimate and reduce environmental disagreement, achieving SOTA performance and mitigating negative transfer.

Conclusion: Mitigating cross-domain environmental disagreement via causal/non-causal disentanglement reduces negative transfer and enhances UDA performance; RED demonstrates effectiveness empirically.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CA-GAN：先提取因果图，再基于因果节点结构训练条件WGAN-GP，加入强化学习目标对齐因果图，在14个数据集上优于6个SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实表格数据在共享与分析中受隐私和法规限制，现有GAN方法难以同时兼顾因果关系保留、数据效用和可证明的隐私保证，故提出结合因果学习与生成模型的新框架以满足企业需求。

Method: 两阶段：1）因果图提取——从原始数据学习变量间因果结构（可用因果发现算法如NOTEARS/PC或基于约束/评分的方法）；2）条件WGAN-GP——依据因果图的节点结构构建条件生成器和判别器，生成器训练时加入强化学习目标，奖励函数衡量真实与合成数据构建出的因果图相似度（例如基于结构相似度指标）；同时应用隐私保护机制（如差分隐私）在训练中控制信息泄露。

Result: CA-GAN在真实表格数据的合成中提出了一种结合因果结构学习与条件WGAN-GP的两阶段方法，并用强化学习目标来对齐真实与合成数据的因果图，从而提升数据的因果保留、效用和隐私性。

Conclusion: CA-GAN通过在生成器训练中直接考虑因果结构（并用强化学习对齐因果图），有效提高了合成表格数据在因果关系保留、下游任务效用和隐私保护方面的表现，适合企业级应用。

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

*Hao Jia,Penghao Zhao,Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Yangyu Tao,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce RAP: retrieve similar historical analogs and feed their true future as a conditional input to a dual-stream network, improving long-term spatiotemporal forecasts and reducing error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models accumulate errors in long-term rollouts due to inability to fully capture intrinsic dynamical constraints; use historical data to provide non-parametric local dynamics guidance.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP)

Result: RAP surpasses state-of-the-art and analog-only baselines across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation; produces more physically realistic long-term predictions and suppresses error divergence.

Conclusion: Combining parametric deep models with non-parametric retrieved evolutionary exemplars yields stronger dynamic guidance and more realistic long-term predictions, outperforming prior methods and analog-only forecasts.

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FolDE improves ALDE by warm-starting activity predictors with protein language model naturalness scores and using a constant-liar batch selector to increase batch diversity, leading to substantially better discovery of top mutants in simulations; open-source workflow provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ALDE methods pick top predicted mutants each round, producing homogeneous training sets that hurt later prediction accuracy; need to improve end-of-campaign discovery of high-performing mutants.

Method: Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE) with FolDE

Result: Across 20 protein targets in simulation, FolDE found 23% more top-10% mutants than best baseline (p=0.005) and was 55% more likely to find top-1% mutants. Naturalness-based warm-starting was the main contributor; constant-liar batch selector improved diversity but had limited benchmark effect.

Conclusion: Naturalness-informed warm-starting and diversity-aware batch selection make ALDE more effective, enabling more efficient protein optimization and broader accessibility via open-source release.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALQON通过将LoRA适配器合并到FP8量化主干、重构前后向计算并引入行级代理更新，消除LoRA的量化开销，达到约3×的微调速度提升并保持相似精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8对大型矩阵乘法有显著加速，但对LoRA这类小维度矩阵的量化会因额外的量化开销而抵消加速优势，需要一种方法消除这部分开销以在微调阶段获得实际速度提升。

Method: 提出在微调阶段将LoRA适配器直接合并进FP8量化的主干模型，重写合并适配器的前向与反向传播以减少量化开销，并设计行级代理更新（row-wise proxy update）以有效集成较大更新。

Result: 在实验中，FALQON相比现有的量化LoRA方法在保持近似相同精度的同时，实现了约3倍的训练速度提升，并支持端到端FP8流程，无需训练后再量化，方便部署。

Conclusion: FALQON消除了LoRA与量化主干之间的计算路径开销，通过将LoRA适配器在微调时直接合并到FP8量化主干中并重构前后向计算及引入行级代理更新机制，实现了在精度相近的情况下约3倍的训练加速和端到端FP8工作流。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

TL;DR: 建立离散扩散的互信息—去噪损失恒等式(I-MDSE/I-MDCE)，从理论与实践上把DSE/DCE变为紧确的对数似然估计器，支持时间无关与条件似然等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离散扩散模型中常用的去噪损失多被视作变分下界或代理目标，缺乏直接与数据对数似然精确对应的信息论解释；需构建理论工具将离散去噪损失与互信息/对数似然联系起来，以便提供精确的似然估计与低方差估计方法。

Method: 借鉴高斯情形的I-MMSE恒等式，作者在离散情形引入信息-最小去噪分数熵(I-MDSE)与信息-最小去噪交叉熵(I-MDCE)关系，建立互信息与最优去噪分数（或交叉熵）损失之间的等价，进而将数据对数似然分解为时间积分形式；并提出时间无关公式、条件似然估计与耦合蒙特卡洛似然比估计等实用扩展。

Result: 推导得到I-MDSE与I-MDCE恒等式，证明DSE和DCE在最优情况下确实等于分解项，从而可作为对数似然的紧确估计；提出时间无关与条件似然估计方法，并通过合成与真实数据实验验证估计的准确性与方差稳定性。代码开源。

Conclusion: 本文提出离散扩散模型的信息论框架，推导出与互信息相关的有根有据的对数似然估计器，证明常用损失为紧确估计量，并扩展到掩码情形以支持条件似然等应用。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

Motivation: 现有潜变量或技能学习方法常出现退化、技能不可解释或难以泛化到新任务。通过直接从多任务专家示范学习参数化技能并与元策略联合训练，可以获得可复用、可参数化且语义明确的技能，提升在未见任务上的表现。

Method: 联合训练参数化技能策略与选择离散技能及其连续参数的元策略；采用时间维度的变分推断对潜变量进行建模，并引入信息论正则化（例如促使技能可区分并防止退化）来保证技能的时序延展性与语义性。

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准上，DEPS显著优于多任务学习和现有技能学习基线；学到的技能具有易解释的参数（如抓取位置），并能更好地泛化到新任务。

Conclusion: DEPS能从多任务专家示范中有效学习参数化技能，改善对未见任务的泛化，且所学技能语义清晰、可调节，实证上在两个基准上优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

TL;DR: Identify important concept words and salient chunks to build a cheaper partial KG, then use a prebuilt concept graph to fill gaps; yields better performance and lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce LLM calls and costs in graph-based RAG while preserving retrieval quality by identifying key 'concept' words and selecting salient chunks; use an LLM-independent concept graph to fill knowledge gaps.

Method: Graph-Guided Concept Selection

Result: G2ConS reduces KG construction cost, improves retrieval effectiveness and QA quality across multiple real-world datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: G2ConS effectively lowers LLM usage and cost while maintaining or improving retrieval and QA performance by combining chunk selection with a zero-cost concept graph.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in battery parameter identification for lithium-ion batteries: high computational cost and slow convergence of metaheuristic methods, and ML methods' dependence on constant current data. It seeks an accurate, efficient method usable under dynamic EV load profiles.

Method: Train NeuralSPMe on realistic EV load profiles to emulate the Single Particle Model with electrolyte; train PUNet to perform fixed-point iterative parameter updates, reducing per-sample evaluation time and total iterations; evaluate versus metaheuristic baselines on dynamic datasets.

Result: They propose a deep-learning framework combining a neural surrogate (NeuralSPMe) and a parameter update network (PUNet) that together speed up identification by >2000x, improve sample efficiency, and achieve >10x better accuracy versus metaheuristics, especially under dynamic loads.

Conclusion: The framework enables fast, accurate parameter identification for electrochemical battery models under realistic EV dynamic loads, making it practical for online or frequent diagnostics.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify and model non-equilibrium dissipative systems from trajectory data while ensuring interpretability and identifiability

Method: Read and extend the abstract

Result: I-OnsagerNet: neural framework that imposes Onsager/Helmholtz structure, learns potential from stationary density, decomposes drift into reversible/irreversible parts, computes entropy production, applied to polymer stretching and SGLD showing scaling results

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet provides a general, data-driven, physically-constrained approach to discover and interpret non-equilibrium dynamics from trajectories, enabling quantification of irreversibility and insights into complex systems.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational cost of fully resolving turbulence via DNS by developing a scalable ML method combining spectral-element accuracy with Transformer attention to model large-scale turbulence efficiently.

Method: Introduce SEM tokenization separating grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, use Transformer-based attention across spectral-element tokens, train on new 3D isotropic turbulence dataset, evaluate on larger unseen domains and The Well benchmark.

Result: EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element architecture, achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 with 30x speedup over DNS, generalizes to larger domains (up to 4x), and succeeds on The Well benchmark where prior ML models failed.

Conclusion: EddyFormer provides an efficient, generalizable ML surrogate for turbulence simulation that retains spectral accuracy and domain generalization, outperforming previous ML approaches on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

TL;DR: 提出V-SAT，一个结合LLM、VLM、图像处理与ASR的统一视频字幕检测与修正框架，自动发现并修复语言与图像模式下的字幕问题，显著降低SUBER得分并在人为验证下达成高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流媒体与社交平台上视频量激增，现有基于语音转录或OCR的方法在同步、准确性、格式和适应视听上下文能力上不足，需一套自动化、综合的修正工具以减少繁重的后期人工编辑。

Method: V-SAT整合ASR提取语音内容、VLM/图像处理提取视觉线索，并用LLM进行上下文理解与策略生成，针对不同问题类型设计检测与修复模块；最后引入人类在环验证以确保结果质量。

Result: 在全面修复语言模式问题后，SUBER由9.6降至3.54；图像模式问题检测/修复F1约0.80；系统结合人类校验实现高质量字幕注释。

Conclusion: V-SAT能自动处理多种字幕质量问题（同步、错误文本、格式、阅读速度等），在语言模式问题上将SUBER得分从9.6降到3.54，并在图像模式问题上实现约0.80的F1；结合人机校验提供首个全面稳健的字幕注释方案。

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

TL;DR: 提出SPARK：通过自编码器学习物理状态字典并在潜空间插值生成物理增强样本，再用傅里叶增强图ODE建模，解决数值方法和数据驱动方法的局限，在OOD和小样本场景显著优于基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alleviate high computational cost of numerical simulators and data scarcity/distribution shift of data-driven models by generating physics-plausible augmented samples using a learned discrete state dictionary and integrating them with a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE for prediction

Method: Qualitative analysis of methodological novelty and robustness

Result: SPARK constructs a physics-rich discrete latent dictionary via a reconstruction autoencoder, generates augmented samples through interpolation in latent space, and uses a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE to learn long-term dynamics on enriched data; shows strong OOD and low-data performance across benchmarks

Conclusion: 物理引导的数据增强结合频域增强的图ODE在数据稀缺和分布偏移情形下能显著提升动力系统建模的泛化性与稳健性

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文针对ICU生命体征数据缺失问题，构建了一个包含15种插补方法和4种人工缺失生成方法的基准框架，在主要ICU数据集上评估不同插补技术对临床预测模型性能的影响，旨在为研究者提供最佳实践建议并推动机器学习模型临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU数据中存在大量缺失段，劣质或随意的插补（如用零填充）会损害机器学习预测性能，因此需要系统比较和推荐更合适的插补方法以改进临床预测模型。

Method: 建立了一个可扩展的基准测试平台，包含15种时间序列插补方法和4种缺失（amputation）生成策略，在主流ICU数据集上进行评估与比较，重点衡量插补质量及其对下游临床预测任务的影响。

Result: 提出并实现了一个包含多种插补和缺失生成方法的基准框架，提供了不同方法在ICU生命体征插补与下游任务中的对比结果（具体数值在原文中），为选择插补策略提供了实证依据。

Conclusion: 通过系统比较多种插补方法，作者为ICU生命体征数据插补提供了可复用的基准框架，期待通过采用更合适的插补技术提升临床预测模型的准确性并促进其在临床实践中的应用。

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

TL;DR: PRIVET 用极值统计处理最近邻距离，为每个合成样本生成隐私泄漏评分，能检测记忆化、适用于高维与小样本基因数据，且在定量与定性评估上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型训练在敏感数据上导致的隐私泄露问题，提供可解释的样本级隐私评估方法。

Method: 利用极值统计（extreme value statistics）对合成样本与真实数据的最近邻距离分布建模，计算样本级泄漏分数，支持多模态与低样本量场景，比较并验证了其检测效能。

Result: 提出 PRIVET：基于极值统计和最近邻距离的通用样本级隐私泄露评分算法，能在多种模态和高维稀样本情形下检测记忆化和隐私泄露，并与现有方法比较显示优势。

Conclusion: PRIVET 提供了可解释的样本级隐私风险度量，扩展了隐私评估工具箱，但受限于某些计算机视觉嵌入在感知相似性方面的表现。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种非贝叶斯的稀疏乐观信息导向抽样算法SOIDS，能在数据稀缺和数据充足两种极端情形下同时达到最优最坏情况后悔界，且通过引入时变学习率的新分析证明了信息与后悔的最优平衡，并给出实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法要么在数据丰富时受到维度多项式因子的影响，要么在数据贫乏时能消除维度依赖但代价是对轮数T依赖变差；希望设计一个在最坏情形下能同时兼顾两者的算法，不依赖贝叶斯先验。

Method: 基于稀疏信息导向抽样（IDS）思想，构造稀疏乐观信息导向抽样（SOIDS），在选择动作时通过权衡信息增益和潜在后悔值并引入乐观估计；关键分析使用了可随时间变化的学习率，使得同一算法能在两种 regime 间自适应地平衡探索与利用并获得最优界。

Result: 理论上证明SOIDS在最坏情况后悔上同时达到两种 regime 的最优速率（消除了对先验的依赖），并通过实验验证了其在稀疏高维线性bandit问题中的优越性。

Conclusion: SOIDS在无贝叶斯假设下也能同时在数据丰富和贫乏两种 regimes 达到最优的最坏情况后悔界，这是首次给出在两种 regime 都最优的算法，且实证表现良好。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PaTaRM，一种结合偏好感知奖励机制与任务自适应评分细则的统一奖励模型框架，用配对偏好数据构建稳健的点式训练信号并动态生成全局与实例级评分细则，实现高效、可解释的RLHF奖励建模，在多项基准上提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有成对方法与点式方法各自缺陷：成对方法只能提供二元偏好导致点式推断不匹配并需复杂配对策略，点式方法需昂贵且脆弱的绝对标注与评分细则。通过利用已有的配对偏好并自动生成任务/实例级评分细则，降低标注成本并提升泛化与可解释性。

Method: 引入偏好感知奖励（PAR）机制，将成对偏好数据转换为连续的点式目标并用于训练，同时设计动态任务自适应评分细则，在全局任务一致性和实例级细粒度推理间生成评估标准，联合优化以训练生成式奖励模型。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B与Qwen3-14B上，PaTaRM在RewardBench与RMBench平均提升4.7%；在IFEval与InFoBench的下游RLHF评测中平均提升13.6%，展示了奖励估计与下游训练的实用收益。

Conclusion: PaTaRM在奖励建模与下游RLHF任务上表现稳健，显著优于现有成对或点式训练范式，提升了RewardBench/RMBench和IFEval/InFoBench上的性能，证明了利用配对偏好构建点式信号并结合任务自适应评分细则的有效性与通用性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper extends TLogic with category-aware rules and LLM-based category generation, achieving accurate, explainable temporal KG predictions and analyzing score aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend rule-based TLogic to improve temporal KG prediction with explainability and high accuracy by incorporating entity categories and LLM-driven category generation.

Method: Modify TLogic rule format to include entity categories; use LLM to assign categories to entities from data; retrieve candidate entities and aggregate scores using various aggregation functions to predict categories and evaluate performance.

Result: A new rule format adding entity category constraints improves prediction accuracy and explainability; LLM-based method generates categories when unknown; study of aggregation methods for category prediction scores.

Conclusion: Incorporating entity categories into rule application yields more relevant, accurate, and explainable predictions; LLMs can generate categories when missing; aggregation choice affects category prediction performance.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS在潜在空间低秩投影KV并基于无RoPE的稀疏选择只重构重要token，达到6.4x缓存压缩、5.7x注意力速度提升，端到端吞吐量比GPT-fast提升1.4x（4k）和4.5x（32k）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文LLM的KV缓存体积大且带宽需求高，尽管KV在隐藏维度上呈低秩，但RoPE使得直接低秩压缩表现差或带来重建开销，需一种在保持RoPE效果下有效压缩KV的方案。

Method: 将KV缓存投影到一个低维潜在空间，利用RoPE-free的查询-键相互作用在潜在空间进行稀疏token选择，仅重构少量重要的token的KV以执行注意力，从而避免对完整KV的重建开销。

Result: 提出了一种在潜在空间进行稀疏注意力（SALS）的方法，通过对KV缓存进行低秩投影并在不使用RoPE的潜在空间中进行查询-键交互，重构少量重要token以避免整体重建开销，从而在保持精度的同时显著压缩KV缓存并提升注意力算子速度。

Conclusion: SALS能在维持竞争精度的同时，显著减少KV缓存占用并加速注意力计算，适用于长上下文推理并在多个大模型和长序列基准上取得SOTA表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Method: 使用方程发现方法在二分类情形下搜索解析函数作为决策函数，采用一个由若干加法项组成的文法：包括线性、二次、指数以及两个特征乘积项（适合捕捉XOR样式依赖）。通过参数拟合和结构搜索同时确定模型形式与参数值。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上，EDC能恢复目标方程的结构与参数，分类性能优于现有ED基线并接近最先进分类方法；所提出文法在表达灵活性与防止过拟合之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: EDC能发现既解释性强又不易过拟合的决策边界表达式，能恢复目标方程结构和参数，在二分类任务上超越现有ED方法并接近最先进分类器性能，且文法可配置以适应不同领域。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN: a Transformer PFN trained on synthetic GMM data to do fast, scalable Bayesian clustering with missing-data-aware priors, better cluster-number estimation and competitive clustering quality


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend PFNs to Bayesian clustering to handle uncertainty and missing data at scale

Method: Train a Transformer-based PFN on synthetic datasets sampled from finite GMM prior to learn posterior over number of clusters and assignments; can incorporate complex priors including missing-data mechanisms; compare to AIC/BIC/VI and imputation baselines on real datasets

Result: Cluster-PFN estimates posterior over number of clusters and assignments, outperforms AIC/BIC/VI in estimating cluster count, competitive clustering quality with much faster runtime, handles missing data better than imputation baselines

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN offers scalable, flexible Bayesian clustering that accurately estimates cluster count, matches VI clustering quality, handles high missingness, and is much faster

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

TL;DR: 系统评估显示当前VLM在ICL上主要依赖文本信息，视觉整合能力弱，训练与微调策略影响ICL表现且存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM中ICL广泛研究，但VLM中的多模态ICL效果尚未充分探讨；需系统评估不同因素对VLM ICL的影响。

Method: 在三个人像描述任务上，评估七个VLM（四种架构），通过对比提示设计、模型架构、训练策略，以及注意力模式随示例数量变化的分析来研究多模态ICL。

Result: 发现交叉图文训练能提升ICL表现但未必实现示例中视觉-文本信息的有效融合；指令微调提升指令遵从性但降低对示例依赖；注意力分析显示模型主要关注文本，视觉利用受限。

Conclusion: VLMs的ICL能力有限，存在文本主导、视觉整合不足的问题，且训练策略和指令微调会影响ICL表现产生权衡。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Perception Learning (PeL)范式：用与任务无关的信号优化感知接口 f_phi，使其在不依赖下游决策学习 g_theta 的情况下具备稳定性、信息性和可控几何等感知性质；形式化感知-决策分离，定义与目标或重参数化无关的感知性质，证明保持充分不变性的PeL更新与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交，并给出一组任务无关的评估指标以证明感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多系统中感知模块应具备普适且可认证的性质（如对干扰的稳定性和信息完整性），但传统端到端或任务驱动训练难以保证这些性质或在任务切换时迁移。PeL旨在独立训练感知接口以获得可证明的、任务无关的感知质量。

Method: 定义感知/决策分离框架，设计基于表征不变性的任务无关目标来训练感知映射 f_phi；证明数学性质——保持充分不变性时PeL更新与下游贝叶斯风险梯度正交；并提出若干无标签评估指标（如稳健性、互信息近似或表征几何量度）来度量感知质量。

Result: 理论证明PeL更新与贝叶斯任务风险梯度在保持足够不变性下正交；提出并实现一套任务无关评估指标用于验证感知质量（稳定性、无坍缩的信息性、可控表征几何）。

Conclusion: PeL能在不依赖任务标签或下游决策的情况下，通过优化感知接口来获得稳定、有信息且几何可控的表示；理论上，其更新在保护必要不变性的前提下不会干扰贝叶斯最小化任务风险；并可通过提出的任务无关度量来认证感知质量。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过训练时剔除高IH样本并在推理时拒绝低置信预测，能在医疗场景下提升模型可靠性，是一种简单有效的安全部署策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，模型在低置信度情况下仍给出预测可能造成严重后果；因此需要一种实用方法既提高训练数据质量又在推理时过滤不可靠预测以提升系统安全性和可靠性。

Method: 方法包括：1) 利用实例难度(Instance Hardness, IH)指标在训练阶段筛除高难度或噪声样本以提升数据质量；2) 在推理阶段引入基于置信度的拒绝机制，剔除低置信度预测以提高可靠性。并用影响力值(influence)和不确定性(uncertainty)作为替代基线分别用于筛除与拒绝步骤的比较。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上的实验显示：与基线（如影响力筛除或不确定性拒绝）相比，IH筛除+置信度拒绝组合在多项性能度量（如准确率、F1、保留率与拒绝率折中）上具有优势，且能保留大量样本，同时显著降低低置信错误预测的发生。

Conclusion: 本文提出的数据中心化两步方法（训练时基于实例难度筛除问题样本，推理时基于置信度拒绝低置信预测）能在真实医疗数据集上提升模型可靠性，在保持较大保留率的同时改善预测性能与拒绝率之间的平衡。

healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 RPU 框架，系统评估合成出行数据在代表性、隐私与效用三方面的质量，并基准比较12种生成方法，发现 CTGAN 在权衡各项指标上最优，强调需任务与群组敏感的综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成智能卡出行数据评估零散且不全面，多数只关注总体代表性或记录级隐私，忽视群组差异和任务专用效用，导致对合成数据可靠性、安全性和实用性的理解不足。

Method: 提出 RPU（Representativeness-Privacy-Utility）评估框架，三维度（代表性/隐私/效用）×三层次（记录/群组/总体），并用一致性度量集合评估相似性、泄露风险与任务效用；对比12种生成方法（统计模型、深度生成模型、隐私增强变体）。

Result: 实验基准显示：合成数据并不自动保证隐私；隐私与代表性/效用存在明显权衡；没有单一模型适用于所有场景；CTGAN 给出最均衡的表现。

Conclusion: Synthetic data 未必天然保障隐私，且不存在普适最佳生成模型；CTGAN 在代表性、隐私、效用三者间表现较平衡。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

TL;DR: APEX提出用结构化神经代理实现对超大可组合合成库的快速近似穷尽搜索，能在消费GPU上亚分钟级枚举并精确检索近似top-k，实验证明比现有方法更准确更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对数十亿级别的按需合成化学库，传统虚拟筛选在计算预算下只能评估极少部分化合物，导致高得分化合物可能被遗漏，且算法较少支持在筛选过程中重用已计算信息。

Method: 构建神经网络代理模型预测目标评分与约束，利用CSL的分子构成结构化表示实现快速打分与枚举；开发包含>1000万化合物并带有真值对接分数与物化属性的基准库，用以评估检索准确率与运行时间。

Result: 在10M级基准库上，APEX在检索准确性和运行时间上均优于其他方法，能在消费GPU上<1分钟完成全库近似枚举并返回近似top-k集合。

Conclusion: APEX通过使用神经网络代理和利用可组合合成库（CSL）的结构，实现了近似但穷尽的搜索，从而在消费级GPU上快速枚举并精确检索近似top-k集合，显著提高了虚拟筛选在超大库上的效率。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

TL;DR: 用少量成功示范离线预估值函数作为早期学习目标，再在线微调，显著提升稀疏奖励环境的样本效率与收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中，随机探索难以获得有效反馈，使用成功示范提供的价值信息作为先验能引导学习更快找到有希望的策略。

Method: 从示范轨迹离线计算状态-动作价值估计（例如蒙特卡洛或回放），用这些估计作为早期Q/价值网络的训练目标，之后切换到常规在线RL更新来进一步优化。

Result: Precompute value estimates from offline demonstrations to initialize value function; use as targets for early learning; then online refinement.

Conclusion: 方法为稀疏奖励场景提供了有用先验，减少探索负担，即使示范稀少或次优也能加速训练并优于基线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数强化学习算法在离散时间下设计，但实际控制系统常为连续时间，直接离散化会带来误差与效率问题；因此需要在连续时间框架下，使用不确定性感知的模型基方法以提升样本效率与可扩展性，同时提供理论保证。

Method: 用高斯过程或贝叶斯神经网络对连续时间非线性ODE系统建模以获得模型的表征与不确定性；定义一个基于即时奖励与模型表观不确定性加权和的目标，采用贪婪策略(maximize weighted sum)进行数据采集与策略更新；在理论上分析奖励驱动下的遗憾界以及无监督下的样本复杂度，并在多种深度RL任务上与基线比较。

Result: 证明COMBRL在奖励设定下具有次线性遗憾，上述无奖励设定给出样本复杂度上界；实验证明在多种任务中样本效率与扩展性优于先前方法和基线。

Conclusion: COMBRL在连续时间模型基强化学习中，通过结合概率动力学模型与基于不确定性的贪婪策略，既能保证理论性能（奖励情形下次线性遗憾、无监督情形样本复杂度），又在实验上实现比基线更好的样本效率与扩展性，适用于标准与无奖励任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

TL;DR: MIMIC-Sepsis：一个可复现的、包含关键治疗信息的MIMIC-IV脓毒症数据集与基准，证明了治疗变量能显著提升预测性能，尤其对Transformer类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常用过时数据、不可复现的预处理以及缺乏治疗变量覆盖，限制了脓毒症预测模型的可靠性与可比较性；因此需要一个可复现、覆盖临床干预的标准化资源以支持方法学评估。

Method: 基于Sepsis-3定义构建队列，设计透明的预处理流水线（缺失值插补策略、时间对齐），提取并标准化治疗变量（升压药、液体、机械通气、抗生素），并定义多个基准任务（早期死亡预测、住院时长估计、休克发生分类）。对比不同模型（尤其Transformer架构），评估是否加入治疗变量的影响。

Result: 构建了包含35,239名ICU患者的队列并开放预处理代码与基准；实验表明加入治疗变量显著提升模型性能，尤其对Transformer模型帮助最大，并提供了若干基线结果供后续研究比较。

Conclusion: 该论文构建并发布了一个基于MIMIC-IV的标准化、可复现的脓毒症ICU数据集及基准框架（MIMIC-Sepsis），强调包含时间对齐的临床变量与关键治疗数据，便于研究脓毒症病程建模与预测。

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

*Qingyue Zhang,Chang Chu,Tianren Peng,Qi Li,Xiangyang Luo,Zhihao Jiang,Shao-Lun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于渐近分析的面向数据的LoRA初始化理论，分解为偏差（用Fisher梯度保持各向异性）和方差（通过Fisher信息），得到最优初始化并实现LoRA-DA算法，从少量目标域样本估计项，显著提升微调性能与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study and improve LoRA initialization for PEFT in LLMs, addressing limitations of prior methods that ignore target-domain data or rely on weak one-step gradient approximations and isotropic assumptions.

Method: Start from minimizing expected parameter discrepancy between fine-tuned and target models; asymptotic analysis yields optimization with bias term approximated by Fisher-gradient and variance term from Fisher information; solve analytically for optimal LoRA init; implement LoRA-DA to estimate necessary matrices/vectors from small dataset and apply initialization.

Result: The paper derives a theoretical framework splitting objective into bias (Fisher-gradient based to preserve anisotropy) and variance (via Fisher information), solves for optimal LoRA initialization, and proposes LoRA-DA algorithm that estimates terms from few target samples. Empirically, LoRA-DA improves accuracy, convergence stability, robustness across ranks, with small overhead.

Conclusion: Data-aware Fisher-based decomposition yields an optimal LoRA initialization; LoRA-DA effectively estimates it from limited target data, improving final accuracy, convergence speed/stability, and robustness with minimal cost.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 当标签自相关存在时，传统DF（用MSE）有偏，DistDF用可微的联合Wasserstein差异替代MSE以对齐分布，提升预测性能并达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列预测中，当标签序列存在自相关时，直接最小化条件负对数似然（如均方误差）会产生偏差，需要新的方法来对齐模型预测的条件分布与标签的条件分布。

Method: 将训练目标从条件负对数似然（MSE）替换为最小化预测和标签的联合分布Wasserstein差异。由于直接估计条件差异困难，证明所提联合Wasserstein差异上界原始条件差异；提出可微、可从经验样本估计的近似计算方法，并将其与梯度下降训练流程结合，进行大量实验验证。

Result: 提出了DistDF，通过最小化预测与标签分布之间的差异来实现对齐；引入了一个新的联合分布Wasserstein差异（joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy），它可以上界关心的条件差异，并能从有限样本中可微可估计，易于与梯度训练集成；实验证明DistDF能提升多种预测模型并达SOTA。

Conclusion: DistDF在理论和实践上都更适合含自相关标签的时间序列预测：理论上通过联合分布Wasserstein差异控制条件分布差异；实践上显著提升多种模型的预测结果。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于航天复合材料结构健康指标（HI）学习的综合数据驱动框架。针对缺乏真实HI标签问题，提出了两种方法：一种是带连续辅助标签的半监督异常检测方法（Diversity-DeepSAD），另一种是嵌入退化趋势约束的变分自编码器（DTC-VAE）。分别结合多域信号处理和多频激励导波数据，并通过无监督集成融合各频率HI。实验表明DTC-VAE表现最好（92.3%），Diversity-DeepSAD在FFT特征下也有81.6%的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合材料结构的健康监测受材料和损伤演化的随机性、多种损伤模态及制造缺陷和服役事件的影响，且真实健康指标难以标注，故需发展无需真实HI标签且能捕捉渐进退化的鲁棒数据驱动方法。

Method: （1）数据来源：对单加劲肋复合结构施加疲劳加载并用多频导波激励采集时域、频域和时频域信号；（2）特征：提取FFT等多域特征并按频率分通道；（3）学习方法：A. Diversity-DeepSAD：半监督异常检测，使用连续辅助标签作为假设性损伤代理来增强学习多样性；B. DTC-VAE：变分自编码器，在潜变量或重建上施加降级趋势单调性约束以保证HI随损伤累积单调变化；（4）融合集成：对各频率HI进行无监督集成以减轻频率依赖并降低方差。

Result: 使用FFT特征时，Diversity-DeepSAD达到81.6%的表现，而DTC-VAE最稳定且性能最高，达到92.3%，同时在多域特征和多频融合下能更好地减轻频率依赖性并降低估计方差。

Conclusion: 在缺乏真实HI标签的情况下，嵌入退化单调性约束的DTC-VAE能更稳定地提取出可解释且一致的健康指标，优于基于辅助连续标签的Diversity-DeepSAD和其他基线方法。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种在单次ILP训练过程中保存中间假设并基于最小描述长度(MDL)加权组合这些假设的方法。实验表明，在游戏和视觉推理等基准上，预测准确率提升约4%，计算开销低于1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ILP多采用单一最终假设，忽略训练过程中的有用中间假设；而重新多次训练以构建集合方法开销大。利用中间假设可在不显著增加计算成本下获得集合效应。

Method: 在ILP算法的单次训练过程中，不丢弃中间产生的多个假设；对每个假设计算其MDL得分（结合假设复杂度与数据编码长度），将得分转为权重，最后对多个假设的预测按权重进行集合（加权投票或概率组合）。

Result: 在多个基准（包括游戏玩法与视觉推理任务）上的实验显示，使用该方法能平均提高约4%的预测准确率，同时额外的计算开销低于1%。

Conclusion: 通过在单次训练中保存并组合中间假设，使用MDL权重能够显著提高ILP的预测性能，同时几乎不增加计算成本。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决时间序列因果发现中单一因果排序表示能力受限的问题，提高恢复真实有向无环图（DAG）传递闭包的能力。

Conclusion: 在平稳性和加性噪声假设下，DOTS能更好地恢复时序因果图的传递闭包，提升F1分数并降低计算成本，是可扩展且鲁棒的时间序列因果发现方法。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

### [117] [The Cost of Robustness: Tighter Bounds on Parameter Complexity for Robust Memorization in ReLU Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24643)
*Yujun Kim,Chaewon Moon,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究ReLU网络在鲁棒记忆下的最少参数需求，针对ρ=μ/ε在(0,1)上给出更紧的上下界：ρ小时时与非鲁棒相同，ρ增大时参数需求上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在需要鲁棒预测（对训练点周围扰动不敏感）时，神经网络记忆任意标记数据所需的最少参数数目。此前工作只在部分ρ范围或给出松弛界，本研究在全ρ范围内提供细化结果以填补空白。

Method: 作者对神经网络构造与信息论/组合下界进行了细致分析：一方面构造满足鲁棒性的ReLU网络以获得参数上界；另一方面通过编码/度量分离性和几何覆盖参数空间，推导出参数下界。分析涵盖全ρ范围，并在不同ρ区间采用不同构造与下界技术以得到更紧的界。

Result: 给出随ρ变化的上界和下界，证明当ρ很小时，所需参数与非鲁棒记忆相同；当ρ增加时，参数复杂度上升，并给出明确函数关系（比之前结果更紧）。总体上，建立了鲁棒记忆参数复杂度关于ρ的精确刻画的更强结论。

Conclusion: 本文研究了ReLU网络在鲁棒记忆（robust memorization）下的参数复杂度，结果表明：在训练样本间存在ε分离的条件下，要求对每个样本在μ球内预测保持一致时，所需参数数目随鲁棒比ρ=μ/ε增大而增加。当ρ较小时，鲁棒记忆的参数复杂度与非鲁棒记忆相匹配；随着ρ增大，参数复杂度上升。文中给出了ρ∈(0,1)范围内的细粒度上下界，较之前工作更紧。

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

TL;DR: Pearl is an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion foundation model trained with large synthetic datasets and controllable inference, achieving significant SOTA gains in protein-ligand pose prediction and scaling with data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity, physical invalidity, inefficiency, and limited conditional control in protein-ligand cofolding; improve accuracy and generalization.

Method: Analyse methods and innovations

Result: Pearl achieves SOTA improvements on Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters, 14.5% and 14.2% over next best; 3.6x improvement at RMSD<1Å on proprietary targets; performance scales with synthetic data size.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data, equivariant diffusion architecture, and controllable multi-chain templating yields major improvements in accuracy and physical validity for protein-ligand cofolding; performance improves with more synthetic data.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

*Burak Varıcı,Che-Ping Tsai,Ritabrata Ray,Nicholas M. Boffi,Pradeep Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个可扩展框架用于从上下文核中提取有序且可识别的特征函数（eigenfunctions），并用实验证明这些特征值可作为特征选择的重要性评分，从而实现效率-精度的自适应权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比与非对比表示学习方法仅能恢复核的特征函数的线性张量(span)，但无法进行精确的谱分解，从而难以确定特征的排序与重要性，因此需要一个能提取有序且可识别特征函数的通用框架。

Method: 设计模块化构件以满足与上下文核的兼容性和可扩展性，结合低秩近似和Rayleigh商优化两大方法范式来提取特征函数；在合成核上验证精确分解能力，并在图像任务上评估特征值用于特征选择的效果。

Result: This paper proposes a framework for extracting ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions from a contextual kernel induced by inputs and contexts, addressing limitations of existing contrastive and non-contrastive objectives that only recover a linear span of top eigenfunctions. It introduces modular building blocks satisfying compatibility and scalability desiderata, aligns low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization with the framework, and demonstrates empirical validation on synthetic kernels and real-world image datasets showing eigenvalues as importance scores for feature selection enabling adaptive-dimensional representations.

Conclusion: 框架能够有序且可识别地恢复核的特征函数，并在合成与真实图像数据上验证，特征值可用于指导特征选择和实现自适应维度表示，有利于效率与准确率之间的权衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

TL;DR: 将分层的 options 框架用于高速公路自动驾驶，设计纵横向专用选项并嵌入安全/舒适约束，混合选项策略在不同交通条件下表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 options 框架天然适合层级控制，但在自动驾驶领域应用较少，作者旨在将领域先验（如安全、舒适约束和纵横向分离控制）嵌入学习过程，以增强可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 在 options 框架下定义长/横向 manoeuvre 选项，构建多种层次控制设置（包括组合与混合选项），并使用现代强化学习算法对策略进行学习，比较基线的动作级策略与不同选项策略的表现。

Result: 作者将 options（技能/子策略）框架应用于高速公路自动驾驶，设计了专门的纵向和横向 manoeuvres 选项，并在这些选项中嵌入了安全与舒适性约束。通过分开选择纵向和横向动作，提出的混合选项策略兼具人类驾驶的灵活性和比连续动作策略更好的可解释性。在多种交通条件下，混合选项策略优于基准动作策略。

Conclusion: 使用带有安全与舒适约束的纵横向专用选项并在层次结构中组合，可以提高自动驾驶在高速公路场景下的性能与可解释性，混合选项策略表现优于直接对连续动作建模的基线。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

### [121] [Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24700)
*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that for KL-regularized RLHF with general preference models, simple greedy sampling on empirical estimates achieves strong performance guarantees, improving prior work and contradicting need for optimistic/pessimistic methods; also applies to BT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to provide theoretical understanding and improved performance guarantees for RLHF under general preference models, addressing challenges of KL-regularized targets learned with only preference feedback.

Method: Theoretical analysis leveraging structural properties of optimal policies under KL regularization; deriving guarantees for greedy sampling and comparing to prior optimistic/pessimistic algorithms; specialization to BT model.

Result: They obtain order-wise improved performance guarantees for general preference models and show greedy sampling (empirical estimates) suffices, rather than optimism/pessimism constructions; also specialize to BT model.

Conclusion: Greedy sampling using empirical preference estimates is sufficient for achieving strong guarantees in RLHF under KL-regularized targets across general and BT preference models, due to structural properties of the optimal policy class.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

### [122] [Uncovering Gaps Between RFC Updates and TCP/IP Implementations: LLM-Facilitated Differential Checks on Intermediate Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24408)
*Yifan Wu,Xuewei Feng,Yuxiang Yang,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一个基于大模型与差异化分析的自动化框架，用于检测内核TCP/IP协议栈实现与RFC规范间的不一致，从而发现潜在漏洞。方法通过建模协议迭代关系、基于RFC迭代更新对内核不同版本代码做增量功能分析与差分检测。评估显示该框架能有效识别由RFC与实现不一致引发的潜在安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协议与实现之间由于规范复杂、跨层交互不确定性及RFC频繁迭代，容易产生实现与规范不一致，进而带来功能偏差或安全漏洞，因此需要自动化、可扩展的方法检测并定位这些不一致，从而提升网络协议栈的安全性和正确性。

Method: 1) 利用LLM从RFC中抽取协议规范与状态机、并建模规范的迭代更新关系；2) 对不同内核版本的协议栈代码做增量差分分析，结合符号执行/静态分析获取函数行为语义；3) 将代码行为与从RFC抽取的规范进行对齐与差异检测，自动标记不一致并推断潜在安全影响。

Result: 通过大规模实验评估，框架在多版本内核TCP/IP实现上成功检测出若干与RFC不一致的实现点，并定位出对应的潜在漏洞示例，展示了良好的检测能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于LLM与差异化模型的自动化分析框架能在核实现与RFC规范之间发现不一致，帮助定位潜在漏洞并提升协议栈安全性；方法在多版本内核代码上经过评估，证明具有效验实用性与可扩展性。

Abstract: As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack
undertakes the task of network data transmission. However, due to the
complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction,
there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol
stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to
differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security
vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack
functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly
important to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large
language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol
specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol
stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other
related content. However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or
rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol
specifications. Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies
remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an automated
analysis framework based on LLM and differential models. By modeling the
iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update
relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis
on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform
code detection and vulnerability analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations to
validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in
identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出SAND，一种结合自监督学习和神经结构搜索的硬件木马检测框架，自动提取特征并自适应优化分类器，以提高检测准确率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的硬件木马检测依赖手工特征且缺乏自适应性，导致对不同木马攻击效果不稳，需一种自动化、可迁移和鲁棒的检测框架。

Method: 先用自监督学习在大量未标注硬件数据上预训练编码器以自动学习表征；再用神经结构搜索在目标数据集上搜索并微调下游分类器架构，达到最优分类性能；最后在测试集上与现有方法比较并进行规避攻击与泛化性评估。

Result: 实验显示SAND在多个基准上将检测精度最多提升18.3%，在面对规避策略时性能下降较小，并在新基准上有良好泛化表现。

Conclusion: SAND通过SSL自动抽取鲁棒特征并借助NAS对下游分类器结构进行动态优化，显著提高了硬件木马检测性能（最大提升18.3%），对规避攻击具备较强鲁棒性且能很好泛化到未见基准。

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP作为连接LLM与外部工具的数据交换协议，其开放性与可扩展性虽提高开发便利性，却引入新型安全风险，迫切需要系统性安全分析与防护方法。

Method: 本文通过系统性威胁建模、分类现有攻击场景、梳理与评估现有防御方案（包括分层检测流水线、基于agent的审计框架、零信任注册表以及运行时交互监控），并从语义攻击角度提出未来研究方向。

Result: This paper identifies security vulnerabilities in MCP-based systems and categorizes threats into agent hijacking, web vulnerabilities, and supply chain risks. It surveys defense strategies including server-side scanning, layered detection pipelines, agentic auditing, zero-trust registries, and runtime monitoring; emphasizes the need for novel defenses due to semantic attack surface expansion.

Conclusion: MCP安全是新范式，需开发针对语义层面攻击的检测与防御机制，结合预防性审查（注册表与扫描）与持续的运行时策略执行以保障用户数据与系统完整性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface
enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external
data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity
and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce
critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user
data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of
MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent
hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional
web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address
these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies,
examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered
detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry
systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous
oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security
fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from
traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language
metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat
model.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QueryIPI is a query-agnostic IPI attack that uses leaked internal prompts to iteratively craft malicious tool descriptions, achieving high success and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IPI attacks are query-specific and unstable; need a query-agnostic method exploiting internal prompt leakage to make attacks robust across inputs.

Method: Query-based white-box optimization of tool descriptions

Result: QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions iteratively using leaked internal prompt, achieving up to 87% success on five simulated agents and transferring to real-world systems.

Conclusion: Leakage of internal prompts enables high-success, query-agnostic IPI attacks on coding agents; defenses must prevent prompt leakage and harden tool description handling.

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and
system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect
Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,
leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more
severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user
inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:
leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a
constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first
query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool
descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked
internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI
achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated
malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a
practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件钱包运行于微控制器上，易受恶意软件和侧信道攻击，攻击者可通过攻击关键算法（如ECC）提取私钥，因此需要专门的硬件架构提供更高的安全性同时保持便携性。

Method: 提出硬件体系结构：1）硬件实现的密钥生成模块用于分层确定性（HD）以太坊钱包；2）设计并实现侧信道与时间攻击抗性的ECC加速器，保证执行行为在不同输入下的均一性；3）实现子密钥派生函数的硬件模块以支持HD钱包链式密钥生成；所有模块在FPGA上综合以最小化资源占用。

Conclusion: EthVault在FPGA上实现并验证了小资源占用和抗侧信道/时间攻击的ECC与CKD硬件模块，证明了在以太坊冷钱包中用定制硬件提高安全性和可移植性的可行性。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using
cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating,
storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and
cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are
generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers.
Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing
perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as
ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize
transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first
hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet,
featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation.
Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is
proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a
fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design
minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable
cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of
the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior
across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6%
of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+
FPGA.

Motivation: 保护开源LLM的产权与验证文本来源，现有水印方法在不开源模型上成熟，但无法直接用于开源模型因无法控制解码过程。需将水印嵌入模型权重且不损害可检测性。

Method: 联合训练一个水印策略模型与开源LLM，使生成的水印模式更易学习并与检测标准一致；加入正则项模拟下游修改并惩罚可检测性下降，以确保鲁棒性。

Result: 提出PRO方法，通过联合训练水印策略模型与LLM并引入正则化模拟下游扰动，显著提高在开源模型上的水印可检测性与对模型修改的鲁棒性，在LLaMA-3.2、LLaMA-3、Phi-2上表现良好。

Conclusion: PRO能有效将水印嵌入开源LLM，解决了匹配性与脆弱性问题，为开源模型提供可用的来源验证手段。

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

Method: Design and implement an LLM-based system that attracts scam attempts, uses engineered prompts and multi-step dialogue management to sustain believable conversations, and incorporates capabilities to meet or evade scammers' milestones.

Result: Successfully deployed system that engaged scammers over extended periods, revealing tactics and enabling large-scale data collection for analysis.

Conclusion: CHATTERBOX demonstrates that LLMs can automate long-term scam engagement, enabling scalable investigations and insights into scam workflows.

Abstract: Pig butchering, and similar interactive online scams, lower their victims'
defenses by building trust over extended periods of conversation - sometimes
weeks or months. They have become increasingly public losses (at least $75B by
one recent study). However, because of their long-term conversational nature,
they are extremely challenging to investigate at scale. In this paper, we
describe the motivation, design, implementation, and experience with
CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system that automates long-term engagement with online
scammers, making large-scale investigations of their tactics possible. We
describe the techniques we have developed to attract scam attempts, the system
and LLM-engineering required to convincingly engage with scammers, and the
necessary capabilities required to satisfy or evade "milestones" in scammers'
workflow.

*Marcin Spoczynski,Marcela S. Melara*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 在GPU上本地执行加密完整性校验，利用专用算力单元并与模型执行共置，消除CPU验证瓶颈，统一跨厂商机制，适配超大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing integrity verification runs on CPUs separate from GPU ML execution causing bottlenecks and mismatch; need standardized, efficient verification across CPUs/GPUs for large models.

Method: GPU-native cryptographic integrity verification for distributed ML

Result: Framework performs cryptographic ops on GPUs using dedicated units (XMX, Tensor Cores), co-locating verification with model execution, reducing overheads and supporting >100GB models; hardware-agnostic across vendors and anticipates secure channels/TEE-GPU integration.

Conclusion: GPU本地化的完整性验证可显著降低分布式ML的验证开销并实现跨硬件一致性，为企业部署提供可扩展、硬件无关的基础，尤其当未来支持TEE与GPU的安全通道时更具长期价值。

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨智能设备（尤其面向青少年的设备）如何暗中捕获私人谈话，分析对青少年隐私的深远影响并提出可行的技术与监管对策。

Method: 采用PRISMA结构化文献回顾，聚焦隐私关切、数据捕获手段、数据存储与共享实践及技术缓解方案；通过SCOUR框架组织与综合发现。

Result: 智能设备在未经同意下捕获私人谈话；对青少年隐私影响显著；提出SCOUR框架（监控机制、同意与知情、运行数据流、使用与滥用、监管与技术保障）；证据主要来自智能玩具和语音助手类设备；问题源于模糊的数据收集实践和透明度不足；建议在法规与技术上加强透明度、同意机制和数据最小化；识别研究空白并提出未来方向；指出文献综述的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要在法规、产品设计与技术实现层面强化透明度、明确同意、实施数据最小化与本地处理，以保护青少年隐私，并推动进一步研究填补方法与实践证据的空白。

Abstract: This paper investigates how smart devices covertly capture private
conversations and discusses in more in-depth the implications of this for youth
privacy. Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the
analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and
sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and
synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing
Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage
and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that
smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart
toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are
worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in
smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is
crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their
personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards
are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future
directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The
findings have significant implications for policy development and the
transparency of data collection for smart devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可追溯签名方案依赖数论/配对假设，面对量子攻击可能失效，需构造后量子安全的替代方案

Method: 采用格密码学工具（如学习带噪声LWE/短整数解SIS技术）、设计适配群签与开权机制的签名和开证流程，并在QROM中用编程哈希/重编程技巧证明不可区分性与追踪性

Result: A lattice-based traceable signature scheme secure in QROM

Conclusion: 作者成功构建了基于格的可追溯签名方案，并在QROM下给出形式化安全证明，表明在量子计算威胁下仍能保持匿名性与可追踪性

Abstract: Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital
signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in
group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures,
but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason,
they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers. This work revisits
the notion of traceable signatures and presents a lattice-based construction
provably secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).

TL;DR: Introduces CMCS vulnerability from shared web-views enabling cross-mini-program cookie access; builds MiCoScan static analyzer; finds widespread vulnerabilities and many potential collusion attacks in real-world mini-programs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate security risks from shared web-view environments allowing cookie sharing across mini-programs (CMCS) and measure prevalence in major platforms' ecosystems

Method: Static analysis of web-view isolation in mini-programs

Result: Identified CMCS vulnerability across WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, Baidu; demonstrated collusion attacks; developed MiCoScan to detect affected mini-programs; analyzed 351,483 mini-programs and found extensive clusters and vulnerable apps

Conclusion: CMCS is widespread across major mini-program platforms, enabling collusion attacks via shared cookies; urgent need for stronger isolation and mitigation techniques in mini-program ecosystems

Abstract: Mini-programs, an emerging mobile application paradigm within super-apps,
offer a seamless and installation-free experience. However, the adoption of the
web-view component has disrupted their isolation mechanisms, exposing new
attack surfaces and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel
vulnerability called Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), which arises
from the shared web-view environment across mini-programs. This vulnerability
allows unauthorized data exchange across mini-programs by enabling one
mini-program to access cookies set by another within the same web-view context,
violating isolation principles. As a preliminary step, we analyzed the web-view
mechanisms of four major platforms, including WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, and
Baidu, and found that all of them are affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the collusion attack enabled by CMCS, where
privileged mini-programs exfiltrate sensitive user data via cookies accessible
to unprivileged mini-programs. To measure the impact of collusion attacks
enabled by CMCS vulnerabilities in the wild, we developed MiCoScan, a static
analysis tool that detects mini-programs affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
MiCoScan employs web-view context modeling to identify clusters of
mini-programs sharing the same web-view domain and cross-webview data flow
analysis to detect sensitive data transmissions to/from web-views. Using
MiCoScan, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 351,483 mini-programs,
identifying 45,448 clusters sharing web-view domains, 7,965 instances of
privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion
attacks. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence and significant
security risks posed by CMCS vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for
improved isolation mechanisms in mini-program ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出CAIBench元基准，覆盖攻防与隐私评估，揭示大模型对安全知识掌握较好但在多步攻防和机器人场景能力不足，模型与框架匹配会极大影响表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于孤立只测单一技能，无法评估网络安全中跨领域、对抗性与执行性任务的劳动力相关能力；预训练知识不等于实际攻防能力，需元基准来衡量综合表现。

Method: 构建五类评估模块（Jeopardy CTF、Attack&Defense CTF、Cyber Range、知识基准、隐私评估），生成1万+实例；设计机器人聚焦挑战RCTF2与隐私基准CyberPII-Bench；对多种SOTA模型与代理进行统一评测，并分析不同模型-框架组合的性能差异。

Result: CAIBench提出一个模块化的元基准框架，用于评估大模型在网络攻防两端的能力，整合了五类评估：CTF类问答、攻防CTF、网络演习、知识基准和隐私评估，包含1万多条样本。实验发现模型在安全知识类上接近饱和（约70%成功率），但在多步对抗场景和机器人相关攻击上表现显著下降（20–40%，机器人约22%）。框架与模型选择的匹配会导致性能变化高达2.6倍，表明知识与实际能力之间存在明显差距。

Conclusion: CAIBench有效揭示LLM在网络安全中知识与能力的差距，强调需构建综合性、劳动力相关的测评以评估实际攻防能力，并提示模型与任务框架匹配重要性。

Abstract: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the
development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks
assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that
pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and
defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address
this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a
modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents
across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards
meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five
evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs,
Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and
privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous
offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges
(RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench).
Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security
knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step
adversarial (A\&D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets
(22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice
significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to
2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a
pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability,
emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.

<details>

Motivation: 智能音箱易受语音回放欺骗，被动活体检测不依赖额外传感器但对环境变化和用户动作敏感，需提高鲁棒性并减少对固定用户姿态的依赖。

Method: 理论分析麦克风圆形布局对阵列特征的鲁棒性，设计阵列指纹并结合其他特征构建轻量级分类器；在包含32780条样本和14种欺骗设备的数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在所用数据集上，ARRAYID达到99.84%准确率，优于现有被动活体检测方法，对环境变化与用户移动更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于麦克风阵列的被动活体检测新特征“阵列指纹”，并实现了轻量级检测方案ARRAYID，显著提升了对回放攻击的识别性能。

Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are
vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which
utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to
distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing
attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the
different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed
user gestures.
  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which
utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to
determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared
with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance
under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a
fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and
elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our
evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing
devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to
existing passive liveness detection schemes.

TL;DR: 针对 Rajendran 等人提出的基于 PUF 的 BNN 列交换保护方案，本文提出了一种基于差分分析的 PUF 密钥恢复攻击：逐位恢复 PUF 密钥以还原被交换的权重和偏置矩阵。对 MNIST 上的 BNN 实验表明可恢复约 85% 的 PUF 密钥，并将模型分类精度恢复到 93%。攻击高效，耗时数分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memristive crossbar 上的 BNN 虽节能但因器件非易失性易遭窃取；先前提出的 PUF 基于列交换方案旨在保护模型，但需验证其抗攻击性。

Method: 受差分密码分析启发，攻击者对每一位 PUF 密钥尝试翻转（或选择），通过比较模型在攻击样本集合上的准确率差异来判断该位的真实值，从而逐位重建完整 PUF 密钥并反向交换列以恢复权重/偏置。

Result: 在 MNIST 的实验中，攻击恢复了约 85% 的 PUF 密钥，并将被保护 BNN 恢复到 93% 的分类精度（原模型 96%），攻击仅需数分钟。

Conclusion: 该 PUF 列交换保护方案存在被动的密钥恢复漏洞，攻击者仅通过查询模型输出准确率变化即可逐位重构 PUF 密钥并恢复 BNN 参数，显示需要更强的防护机制。

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

TL;DR: Proposes Kubernetes-orchestrated containerized HE modules with optimizations (ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, operator fusion) to improve performance and resource use for privacy-preserving ML inference


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address confidentiality of user data during ML inference in cloud environments by enabling computation on encrypted inputs without decryption

Method: Systematic framework integrating HE with cloud-native pipelines

Result: Up to 3.2x inference acceleration and 40% memory reduction vs conventional HE pipelines

Conclusion: Practical pathway for scalable, secure MLaaS under zero-trust clouds via optimized HE workflows

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.

Motivation: 分析在分布式环境中分配资源的挑战，特别是云平台中虚拟机调度与放置的问题，发现现有实践中的低效并提出优化需求。

Method: 利用观测工具收集30天、覆盖1,800个hypervisor和48,000个VM的细粒度时间序列资源与性能指标，分析CPU争用、CPU ready、主机利用率分布和VM资源使用率，基于发现提出需求与优化指导，并发布数据集。

Result: 基于1,800台hypervisor和48,000台VM的30天时间序列遥测数据，发现多种次优调度情形：CPU争用>40%，CPU ready高达220s，主机利用率极度不平衡（部分达99%），超过80%的VM过度配置（实际使用<70%分配资源）。并提供对调度与放置算法设计的需求和优化建议，同时公开数据集。

Conclusion: 现有资源调度存在明显问题：资源争用、长等待、主机负载不均与过度配置。需要新的感知并行/异构负载的调度与放置算法，并可通过公开数据驱动评估改进效果。

Abstract: Allocating resources in a distributed environment is a fundamental challenge.
In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines
(VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource
planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and
48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential
improvements for workload management. The data was measured through
observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across
the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely
offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized
enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP
S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include
several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention
exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced
compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of
up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80%
of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these
findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel
placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource
allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to
enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud
infrastructures in future research.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了GPU上的内存和负载瓶颈，在代表性燃烧问题上实现了亚线性到接近理想的扩展和显著的吞吐量提高，适合大规模化学反应流模拟。

Abstract: High-speed chemically active flows present significant computational
challenges due to their disparate space and time scales, where stiff chemistry
often dominates simulation time. While modern supercomputing scientific codes
achieve exascale performance by leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs),
existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers face critical limitations in
memory management, load balancing, and handling the highly localized nature of
chemical reactions. To this end, we present a high-performance compressible
reacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU
settings. Our approach addresses three GPU performance bottlenecks: memory
access patterns through column-major storage optimization, computational
workload variability via a bulk-sparse integration strategy for chemical
kinetics, and multi-GPU load distribution for adaptive mesh refinement
applications. The solver adapts existing matrix-based chemical kinetics
formulations to multigrid contexts. Using representative combustion
applications including hydrogen-air detonations and jet in supersonic crossflow
configurations, we demonstrate $2-5\times$ performance improvements over
initial GPU implementations with near-ideal weak scaling across $1-96$ NVIDIA
H100 GPUs. Roofline analysis reveals substantial improvements in arithmetic
intensity for both convection ($\sim 10 \times$) and chemistry ($\sim 4

Motivation: MPST variants are numerous and idiosyncratic; designers and learners need clearer insights and interactive ways to compare and teach global choreographies.

Method: Select representative MPST examples; provide mechanisms to combine features; animate and compare semantics of examples; implement tool in JavaScript as open-source browser app.

Result: A tool (CoMPSeT) for exploring and comparing features of Multiparty Session Types (MPST) by animating and combining representative examples; open-source, runs in browser (compiled to JavaScript); useful for researchers and teachers.

Conclusion: CoMPSeT effectively aids understanding of MPST variant features by enabling interactive combination, animation, and semantic comparison of concrete choreographies.

Abstract: Concurrent systems are often complex and difficult to design. Choreographic
languages, such as Multiparty Session Types (MPST), allow the description of
global protocols of interactions by capturing valid patterns of interactions
between participants. Many variations of MPST exist, each one with its rather
specific features and idiosyncrasies. Here we propose a tool (CoMPSeT) that
provides clearer insights over different features in existing MPST. We select a
representative set of MPST examples and provide mechanisms to combine different
features and to animate and compare the semantics of concrete examples. CoMPSeT
is open-source, compiled into JavaScript, and can be directly executed from any
browser, becoming useful both for researchers who want to better understand the
landscape of MPST and for teachers who want to explain global choreographies.

Result: Outperforms classical and neural models on Monash benchmark; scales to 100M series in 1.5 hours in BigQuery; provides interpretable component-level outputs

Conclusion: ARIMA_PLUS successfully balances accuracy, interpretability, and scalability by modular modeling and managed cloud deployment, making it practical for large-scale industrial forecasting and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection are common tasks for
practitioners in industries such as retail, manufacturing, advertising and
energy. Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately
forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically;
and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate
business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these
two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time
series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The
model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of
the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies,
which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made
to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both
forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy,
its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting
repository shows superior performance over not only well-established
statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer
neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms
of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in
Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious
technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically
scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it
possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a
throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of
interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series
insights it generates and customizability it offers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Game-TARS trains a generalist agent on a unified keyboard-mouse action space with 500B tokens, using decaying continual loss and Sparse-Thinking; it achieves strong cross-game performance and outperforms several LLMs in game benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a unified, scalable action space aligned to human keyboard-mouse inputs to enable large-scale continual pretraining across heterogeneous game domains and real computer use.

Method: AnalyzeGame-TARS

Result: 2x success over previous SOTA in Minecraft, comparable to fresh humans in unseen web 3D games, outperforms GPT-5/Gemini-2.5-Pro/Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks; scaling shows benefits preserved.

Conclusion: Unified, human-aligned action representations plus large-scale pretraining enable scalable generalist game agents capable of broad computer-use abilities.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific

Motivation: Address model uncertainty in POMDPs where multiple models exist; find policies robust to worst-case environment.

Method: 理论归约证明与算法设计：将ME-POMDP归约为只变动转移/奖励或只变动观测/奖励的情形；基于值迭代的精确解法与基于点的近似（point-based）方法进行求解。

Result: Introduced AB-POMDPs; reductions showing ME-POMDPs can be limited to varying only transitions/rewards or observations/rewards; developed exact and point-based approximate algorithms to compute robust policies; demonstrated on benchmarks.

Conclusion: AB-POMDP为处理模型不确定性提供了等价且更一般的表述；算法能求解或近似求解鲁棒策略；模型可简化以减少复杂性且保留最优策略。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练Transformer并结合test-time tuning的端到端从MS/MS与分子式直接生成分子结构的方法，显著优于现有方法，特别能适应实验谱图


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on database matching and multi-step pipelines; enable de novo end-to-end structure generation from tandem MS and formula

Method: Transformer with test-time tuning

Result: Outperforms DiffMS by 100% on NPLIB1 and 20% on MassSpecGym; 62% gain of test-time tuning vs conventional fine-tuning on MassSpecGym; generated candidates remain structurally accurate even when incorrect

Conclusion: Test-time tuning使模型能动态适配新谱图，提升结构预测准确性并提供有用的结构候选用于人工判断

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current foundation modeling assumptions clash with tissue complexity; seven causes outlined; need paradigm shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess why foundation models underperform in computational pathology despite success in other domains.

Method: paper analysis

Result: Identified seven interrelated causes explaining FM shortcomings in pathology.

Conclusion: Pathology FMs are conceptually misaligned with tissue morphology; fundamental rethinking required.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReCAP的层级递归框架，通过提前规划子任务、在递归返回时结构化地注入父级计划、以及内存高效的执行策略，在保持跨层级上下文一致性的同时降低提示成本，从而提升LLM在长时序推理与动态重规划任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对序列式提示易发生上下文漂移、目标信息丢失与失败循环，层级式提示又可能破坏跨层级连续性或带来高运行时开销，提出一种在保持跨层一致性的同时降低提示成本的层级递归策略。

Method: ReCAP结合三大机制：1) plan-ahead decomposition：先生成完整子任务列表，执行首个子任务后对剩余任务进行细化；2) 结构化的父计划重注入：在递归返回时保留多层级一致的上下文，将父级计划信息重新注入子流程；3) 内存高效执行：限制活动提示长度，使成本随任务深度线性增长，避免提示冗余与上下文漂移。

Result: 在多个长时序推理任务上显著提升性能，尤其在Robotouille基准下取得严格pass@1的32%（同步）和29%（异步）增益。

Conclusion: ReCAP在多个长时序基准上显著提高了子目标对齐和任务成功率，在严格的pass@1评估下在Robotouille同步/异步任务上分别提升约32%和29%。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively generate goal preferences for decentralized multi-agent path planning, leading to near-optimal assignments under deterministic conflict resolution, outperforming greedy heuristics when given structured information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning using agents that independently rank goals based on structured environment representations and then resolve conflicts deterministically without negotiation.

Method: Paper analysis

Result: LLM-based agents with good prompts and quantitative info achieve near-optimal makespans and outperform traditional heuristics in fully observable grid-worlds.

Conclusion: Language models are promising for decentralized goal assignment; information structure and prompt design are critical for performance.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

TL;DR: introduces j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus to handle context-dependent causal effects via Lawvere-Tierney modality; implements algorithms combining standard causal discovery methods and shows empirical gains


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: causal effects depend on regimes; need local/contextual causal claims

Method: judo calculus in topos of sheaves

Result: decentralized sheaf-theoretic causal discovery with improved efficiency and performance

Conclusion: judo calculus enables constructive, regime-local causal claims and efficient decentralized discovery, outperforming classical methods on varied datasets

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出符号估计器，用二分类损失替代交叉熵，在存在偏好异质性的配对比较数据下提供一致且高效的序数对齐估计，具备多项式有限样本误差界，并在模拟实验中显著改善对齐质量和降低偏好失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于配对比较数据的朴素概率模型在存在偏好异质性时会导致对人口平均效用的估计不一致，影响LLM的社会福利优化；需要一种既简单又能在理论上保证一致性的估计方法来减少偏好失真。

Method: 核心方法是在聚合步骤用二分类（符号）损失替代交叉熵，构建符号估计器，通过二元排序信息估计群体平均效用的方向（序数信息），并在此基础上证明一致性和提供多项式有限样本误差界。

Result: 本文提出了一种用于解决人类偏好异质性导致的LLM对齐问题的新估计器——符号估计器（sign estimator）。该方法通过在聚合步骤中将交叉熵替换为二分类损失，能够在温和假设下恢复一致的序数对齐，并给出多项式有限样本误差界。模拟实验显示，符号估计器在数字孪生面板上显著降低了偏好失真，角度估计误差降低约35%，与真实人口偏好不一致的比例从12%降到8%，且实现简单，不需要跟踪个体级偏好数据，优于一些明确建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法。

Conclusion: 符号估计器在理论和实践上都能更好地应对人类偏好异质性问题，提供一致的序数对齐估计，减少对个体偏好追踪需求，并在有限样本下有可控误差。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [158] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在受扰动事件后，个体出行模式会发生变化。该文提出将个体的社会基础设施韧性（SIR）作为条件，结合深度学习与空间上下文，提高对事件后个体移动模式变化的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏可规模化获取的个体异质性韧性度量，且难以捕捉移动模式与空间情境的复杂交互，导致难以在事件发生前预测个体出行模式的分化。

Method: 构建条件化深度学习模型，输入包含个体的预事件移动序列、SIR指标和局部空间特征；使用大规模稀疏个体级移动数据进行训练与评估；通过对比实验证明引入SIR与空间上下文的增益。

Result: The paper proposes incorporating social infrastructure resilience (SIR) into a conditioned deep learning model to predict individual movement pattern shifts after disruptive events, using large-scale sparse individual-level data and local spatial context.

Conclusion: 将SIR与空间上下文引入条件化深度模型能更好地预测个体在扰动事件后的移动模式，并区分在事件前模式相似但SIR不同的个体的差异性响应。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

### [159] [Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013)
*İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya,İ. Esra Büyüktahtakın,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-guided human-in-the-loop design produced two new heuristics (EDDC, MDDC) that outperform classical rules on SMTT, are scalable, and competitive with exact approaches on large instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage LLMs to discover improved heuristics for NP-hard scheduling problem (SMTT) where exact methods are infeasible at scale.

Method: Use LLMs to generate heuristics inspired by EDD and MDD; evaluate via MIP formulations measuring optimality gaps and runtimes across instance sizes (20,100,200,500 jobs).

Result: EDDC improves over EDD and a common algorithm; MDDC outperforms traditional heuristics and competes with exact methods on larger instances; both scale to 500 jobs.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted heuristics (EDDC and MDDC) improve upon classic rules for SMTT, scaling to larger instances and offering competitive performance vs. exact methods.

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast通过季节/趋势分解、基函数重建季节性和离散扩散建模趋势，实现跨域更鲁棒的时序预测，实验在八个域上优于大多数基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域时间序列预测方法把序列视为无差别的一维序列，未能显式解耦时序中的结构成分（季节性与趋势），因此难以应对各域间的趋势漂移与周期不一致问题。

Method: 双分支框架：1) 季节分支：轻量投影模块+可解释基函数重构周期性；2) 趋势分支：语义感知分段tokenizer将趋势编码为离散token，使用掩码离散扩散模型推断，再与季节分量合并输出。

Result: 提出OneCast——一种结构化模块化的预测框架：将时间序列分解为季节性与趋势分量；季节性用轻量投影模块和可解释基函数重建；趋势用语义感知分段标记器离散化为token，并用掩码离散扩散机制推断。两分支合成最终预测。

Conclusion: 按结构分解时序并分别用针对性生成路径建模季节与趋势，可更好兼顾跨域的周期差异和趋势漂移，提高预测性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Peng Cai,Reza Ryan,Nickson M. Karie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLMLogAnalyzer——基于聚类的日志分析聊天机器人，利用模块化架构和检索/解析组件提升LLM对结构化日志的处理能力，在4类日志与多任务评测中较现有LLM聊天工具提升39%–68%，并显著降低结果波动（ROUGE-1 IQR下降93%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数组织缺乏处理大量、多样化日志的数据与人才，且LLM在长文和结构化文本上表现有限；因此需要一种可扩展、鲁棒且对非技术用户友好的日志分析方案。

Method: 系统先用router分流、log recognizer识别日志类型，再用parser将结构化字段提取并聚类，结合搜索工具对聚类结果和原始日志进行上下文检索，最后由LLM生成摘要、模式或异常报告。评估采用4类真实日志与多任务对比ChatGPT/ChatPDF/NotebookLM，使用ROUGE等指标衡量质量与稳定性。

Result: LLMLogAnalyzer通过结合聚类、LLM与传统ML方法，构建模块化流水线（router、log recognizer、parser、search）以克服LLM上下文窗口与结构化文本处理弱点，实现日志摘要、模式提取与异常检测等任务。

Conclusion: 本文证明将聚类与检索式流水线与LLM结合能显著提高日志分析的准确性与稳定性，使复杂日志任务对非专家更可行。

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，了解其跟车行为对提升交通安全与智能驾驶系统开发至关重要，本研究旨在比较经典动力学模型与机器学习模型在 EV 跟车建模中的表现。

Method: 使用真实世界 EV 跟随 ICE 车辆数据。对 IDM、OVM、OVRV 与简化 CACC，通过最小化 RMSE 标定参数。随机森林以间距、速度、间隙类型为输入，预测加速度，并评估不同间隙（中、长、超长）下的 RMSE。

Result: Random Forest 回归在所给 EV 跟车数据上表现最好，显著优于经典物理模型。经典模型中，简化的 CACC 在长距离间隙下表现最优，但其 RMSE 仍远高于机器学习模型。研究基于实车 EV 跟随 ICE 车辆的真实数据，通过最小化 RMSE 进行经典模型参数标定，且随机森林使用间距、速度和间隙类型作为输入来预测加速度。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法（Random Forest）在建模 EV 跟车行为时能提供更低的预测误差，适用于仿真 EV 行为与混合自主交通分析；经典模型尽管可解释性强，但需改进以匹配数据驱动模型的精度。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

TL;DR: HistoLens 是面向病理学的可解释 AI 助手，支持自然语言提问、将问题转为精确查询、生成结构化报告，并能通过热图等“可视化证据”展示 AI 推理，同时去除背景噪声，保持病理医生主导的工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为打消医生对黑箱 AI 的不信任，提供类似与同事讨论的交互方式和可追溯的证据，确保临床采纳时医生仍为最终决策者。

Method: 系统将自然语言问题转换为对 AI 引擎的精确查询，AI 输出结构化报告；若需解释，系统生成热图指示关键细胞与区域；训练时加入背景噪声忽略机制以聚焦病变组织。

Result: 实现了可用的病理学交互式 AI 助手，支持问答式工作流、可视化证据展示及背景噪声抑制，从而改进诊断效率与可解释性。

Conclusion: HistoLens 提升了病理诊断的透明度与可信度，使医生能在保持主导权的同时借助可解释的 AI 提高诊断速度与信心。

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Motivation: 手工事故管理在大规模云系统中耗时且易错，现有自动化方法难以泛化、解释性差并且部署成本高，因而需要一种可部署、可解释且能长期自我演化的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 核心方法包括：1) 训练-免费数据处理器：将指标、日志、追踪等异构观测数据转为结构化文本描述；2) 多智能体协作框架：分工明确的代理间透明交互以生成可审计诊断；3) 双重自我进化机制：内部模型更新与外部经验积累联合闭环以持续提升能力。

Result: OpsAgent提出了一种轻量级、自我进化的多智能体事故管理系统，通过训练-免费数据处理器将异构观测数据转为结构化文本描述，并采用多智能体协作框架实现可审计的诊断推理；引入双重自我进化机制整合内部模型更新与外部经验积累以实现持续能力提升。

Conclusion: 实验表明OpsAgent在OPENRCA基准上达到了SOTA性能，且在可泛化性、可解释性、成本效率与自我进化能力方面表现良好，适合长期部署于真实云系统。

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Result: A scalable framework that generates high-difficulty, retrieval-resistant but verifiable multi-hop questions via NLI-based relation typing, reverse question construction, and a two-step multi-model/evidence filtering pipeline, producing data suitable for SFT/RL and evaluation while reducing human effort.

Conclusion: 该方法能大幅降低人工成本，生成保持高难度特性的可训练与评估数据，适于训练检索-推理代理并用于挑战性评估。

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: BLM1 is a multimodal spatial foundation model using two-stage training to inject embodied knowledge and train a policy via intent-bridging, achieving better cross-space and cross-embodiment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models fail to generalize across digital/physical spaces and embodiments; need unified model for cross-space, cross-task, cross-embodiment control.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage I injects embodied knowledge into MLLM via curated digital corpora while preserving language competence; Stage II trains a policy module via intent-bridging interface extracting high-level semantics without fine-tuning backbone.

Result: BLM1 integrates cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, cross-embodiment generalization; trained with cross-embodiment demos; outperforms MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, GMLMs by ~6% digital and ~3% physical.

Conclusion: A single BLM1 can robustly operate across digital and physical environments and multiple robot embodiments, improving task success over existing model families.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Conclusion: UniPlanner通过历史-未来轨迹字典检索、无梯度轨迹映射和稀疏到稠密范式，有效整合不同数据集的规划知识，避免捷径学习并在推理时充分利用先验，实现更稳健的规划。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Method: 提出Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA)，采用“先观察后决策”范式；每步输入为（当前截图、空间信息、可更新结构化记忆）；用动态记忆替代长链历史拼接；在OSworld和真实桌面应用上进行对比实验。

Result: 在OSworld基准、Chrome、VSCode、VLC等真实应用与跨任务迁移场景中，MGA在成功率、鲁棒性与效率上均显著优于现有基线（如Mirage与GTA1）。

Conclusion: MGA通过将每个交互步骤建模为以当前截图、任务无关的空间信息和动态结构化记忆为三元组的独立状态，成功解决了历史轨迹依赖和局部探索偏向问题，提升了鲁棒性、泛化性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: MCP-Flow: an automated pipeline that collects large-scale MCP data (1166 servers, 11536 tools) to produce 68733 instruction-function pairs and 6439 trajectories, enabling better LLM agent tool use and improved task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP research is limited in server coverage, relies on manual curation, and lacks training data, which hampers LLMs' real-world MCP deployment. MCP-Flow aims to provide automated large-scale data collection and training to fill this gap.

Method: Developed an automated web-agent pipeline for server discovery, data synthesis, and model training; collected data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools; filtered to produce 68733 instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories; trained models and ran extensive evaluations on tool selection, function-call generation, and agentic tasks.

Result: MCP-Flow outperforms prior approaches, demonstrating superior tool selection, function-call generation, and improved agentic task performance, providing a public resource for future research.

Conclusion: MCP-Flow successfully builds a scalable, automated pipeline that expands MCP dataset scale and diversity, improving LLM agents' ability to select and call external tools in realistic settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven
pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.
MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call
generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a
scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP
environments. MCP-Flow is publicly available at

TL;DR: MCTS中将动作聚合到抽象节点会造成同父动作UCB相同的问题；作者提出并测试多种内部选择策略，若干策略优于现有随机平局规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高MCTS的样本效率，通过在树搜索中并行构建和使用状态/动作抽象以在同一层节点之间共享信息。

Method: 分析抽象增强UCB带来的同值冲突，设计多种抽象内策略（替代随机平局），并在多个环境与参数集上进行实验比较。

Result: 提出并实证评估了多种替代性的抽象内策略，用于处理一组具有相同父节点且落在同一抽象节点的动作导致相同UCB值的问题，发现若干策略在多数环境和参数设置中优于随机打破平局策略。

Conclusion: 在使用抽象增强MCTS时，应使用更好的抽象内选择策略而非随机平局；这些策略可以提高性能且在多种环境和参数下表现更稳定。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该工作提出一种无需外部资源、基于模型内部行为的自检方法（Self-Indicator），通过计算输入与推理路径之间的相关矩阵的秩来判断推理是否正确，并据此重加权候选推理路径，从而显著提升多种大模型在推理任务上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检查LLM输出的方法依赖外部资源（训练的验证器或复杂提示），成本高且领域适应性差。作者假设并验证LLM内部行为已隐含可信度信息，寻找一种只依赖模型自身的高效可信度估计方法。

Method: 对每个候选推理路径，计算输入问题与该路径之间的相关矩阵（可能通过token/表示相关性），提取矩阵的秩作为正确性指示器，然后按该指标为候选路径重加权并选取最终答案。该方法无需外部验证器或特殊提示，属于插拔式后处理。

Result: 在多种规模和家族的LLM上，Self-Indicator在区分正确/错误推理路径上准确率超过75%，并在三个推理基准上将最终准确率提升超过8%。

Conclusion: 相关矩阵的秩是判断LLM推理路径正确性的稳健指标；基于该指标的Self-Indicator方法无需额外训练或复杂提示，计算开销低，与多数投票或验证方法相比能明显提升推理正确率，在多个模型与基准上取得8%以上的性能提升。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Motivation: 提出一种多代理框架，将判断性预测视为针对未来事件的观点验证，通过代理之间的证据辩论来评估事件的可信度。

Method: 提出QBAF多代理形式化框架；实现三类LLM代理（ArgLLM、RbAM、RAG-ArgLLM）；在两个判断性预测数据集上，用六种基础LLM进行两/三代理组合实验，比较准确率与可解释性。

Result: 设计并实例化了基于定量双极论证框架(QBAF)的多代理体系，包含三类由大语言模型驱动的代理（ArgLLM、RbAM、RAG-ArgLLM），并在两个基准数据集上进行实验，显示多代理组合（尤其三代理）能提升预测准确性并提供可解释证据组合。

Conclusion: 多代理框架能通过整合来自不同LLM代理的证据提升判断性预测的表现，并提供透明的论证结构；引入检索或关系型论证挖掘可进一步丰富证据来源。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

TL;DR: VDSAgents embeds Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles into a multi-agent LLM system for data science automation, improving robustness and auditability; outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on nine datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to improve trustworthiness and robustness of LLM-driven data science systems by integrating scientific principles (PCS from VDS) into multi-agent automation, addressing weaknesses when handling noisy/complex real-world data.

Method: Design a modular multi-agent pipeline—agents for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation—each using perturbation analysis, unit tests, and model validation; evaluate against AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter across nine datasets with DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o backends.

Result: Proposed VDSAgents: a PCS-grounded multi-agent system modularizing cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation; includes perturbation analysis, unit testing, model validation; outperforms AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter on nine diverse datasets using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o backends.

Conclusion: Embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven automation is feasible and beneficial, yielding better performance and scientific auditability compared to existing end-to-end systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

TL;DR: 把不同模态模型的内部空间注意力结构映射到人脑功能网络，得到一个统一的“Brain-like Space”，揭示模型按“脑相似性”沿弧形连续分布，受预训练目标与位置编码影响，但与任务性能非同义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合脑科学与人工智能之间的比较鸿沟，创造一个与输入、任务无关的通用框架，来比较不同模态模型的内部组织结构，从而理解AI与大脑组织之间的共性与差异。

Method: 基于151个Transformer模型，计算并提取模型的空间注意力拓扑组织（可能使用注意力矩阵的拓扑学或图嵌入方法），将这些组织映射到标准化的人类功能脑网络，构建统一几何表示并分析模型在该空间中的分布与属性相关性（如模态、预训练范式、位置编码、下游性能）。

Result: 提出“Brain-like Space”概念，将不同模态的Transformer模型通过其空间注意力的拓扑组织映射到人类功能网络，构建一个统一的几何空间以比较模型的脑相似性；在151个Transformer模型上发现弧形连续几何分布，脑相似性随沿弧增加，并受预训练范式（强调全局语义抽象）和位置编码机制影响；模型的脑相似性与下游任务性能并不一致。

Conclusion: Brain-like Space提供了一个跨模态、无任务依赖的统一框架，用以量化和比较AI模型与人脑的组织相似性，发现预训练范式与位置编码是影响脑相似性的关键因素，且脑相似性与实际任务表现并不完全相关。

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

Conclusion: 该方法能提升对边缘病例的可靠性与信任，但面临计算、自动化偏见与监管挑战，需要缓存、共识检查和自适应试验等缓解策略

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable runtime enforcement of constraints and verifiable compliance for deployed AI agents by providing a standardized, machine-readable artifact encoding operational, regulatory, and ethical rules.

Method: Define a standardized Policy Card format that includes rules (allow/deny), obligations, evidentiary requirements, and crosswalks to frameworks; implement validation, version control, and runtime enforcement/continuous-audit integrations; apply in multi-agent ecosystems for distributed assurance.

Result: Defines Policy Cards as a deployment-layer standard that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations, evidence requirements, and mappings to assurance frameworks; supports validation, version control, runtime enforcement, continuous audit, and distributed assurance for multi-agent ecosystems.

Conclusion: Policy Cards bridge governance and engineering by providing verifiable, version-controlled constraints that support runtime enforcement and distributed assurance, facilitating compliance at scale for autonomous agents.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Motivation: 解决将高质量复杂LLM推理部署到要求低延迟高吞吐的实时Web服务时，传统顺序生成和固定推理策略在效率与质量之间的难以权衡问题。

Method: 两个阶段：1) 检索增强的少样本提示生成逻辑化关键点；2) 基于关键点构建依赖图并并行扩展内容；再通过管线调度在多查询间交错执行以利用GPU计算与内存特性。

Result: Orion提出了一种适用于实时Web应用的高效推理框架，通过将单次查询的推理拆分为“关键点生成”和“基于依赖图的并行扩展”两阶段，利用跨查询流水线调度实现计算资源互补，从而显著提升生成速度和降低延迟，同时保持或提升推理质量。

Conclusion: Orion在多项基准测试中实现了最高4.33x的生成速度提升、3.42x的延迟降低以及最高18.75%的质量提升，证明了分解推理并利用跨查询并行性对实时Web场景的有效性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练基准多关注静态孤立技能，无法反映模型的代理能力；而代理基准通常针对后训练模型且成本高，需一个可在预训练阶段评估代理潜力的轻量级基准来指导训练。

Method: 收集真实世界的代理任务与成功轨迹，转换为适配基础模型的多项选择或文本补全题，设计覆盖规划与行动等核心代理能力的题目，并在软件工程与深度研究场景上进行验证。

Result: APTBench相比通用基准能更好预测模型作为代理的下游性能，同时显著节省评估成本，相较于端到端代理评测更轻量高效。

Conclusion: APTBench在预训练阶段提供了更具预测性的代理能力评估信号，能指导模型训练，且较端到端代理评估更轻量、成本更低。

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了多款大型语言模型（如GPT、Claude等）在八道自制逻辑与抽象推理题上的表现，并将其与人类表现进行基准对比，发现模型在演绎推理上存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的推理能力以判断它们超越表面语言任务、实现真正逻辑推理的程度，从而推动AI在更高层次的认知任务发展。

Method: 设计八道自制题目覆盖逻辑与抽象推理，向多款LLM提交问题并记录答案，同时收集人类受试者在相同题目上的表现，比较正确率和错误类型以评估差异。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在一些题目上接近或超过人类，但在需要严格演绎推理和多步逻辑推导的题目上表现较差，常出现错判或给出貌似合理但不严谨的答案。

Conclusion: LLMs在某些推理任务上能表现出色，但总体上仍比人类在逻辑演绎和复杂抽象推理方面弱，需进一步改进模型的推理能力和评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs) is important for
advancing artificial intelligence, as it transcends mere linguistic task
performance. It involves understanding whether these models truly understand
information, perform inferences, and are able to draw conclusions in a logical
and valid way. This study compare logical and abstract reasoning skills of
several LLMs - including GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral,
Perplexity, and Sabi\'a - using a set of eight custom-designed reasoning
questions. The LLM results are benchmarked against human performance on the
same tasks, revealing significant differences and indicating areas where LLMs
struggle with deduction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Law in Silico框架，使用大型语言模型（LLM）模拟包含立法、裁判与执法等制度机制及个体决策的法律社会。通过与真实数据对比，LLM代理能在宏观层面重现犯罪率趋势，并在微观层面显示透明、适应性强的法律体系更能保护弱势群体权利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实法律实验成本高或不可行，需仰赖AI系统模拟以检验法律理论并支持法律行政；LLMs凭借知识与角色扮演能力，是理想基础模型但在法律系统仿真上尚缺乏研究。

Method: 构建Law in Silico框架：用LLM作为代理模拟个体决策，整合立法、裁判、执法三大制度机制，设计实验并将模拟出的犯罪率与真实世界数据对比分析；同时进行微观情景实验以评估制度对弱势群体权利的影响。

Result: 实验表明LLM代理在宏观层面能大体再现犯罪率趋势，且微观实验显示良好、透明且有适应性的法律制度更能保护弱势个体的权利。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的法律社会模拟可有效再现宏观犯罪趋势并提供与现实一致的洞见，且显示出制度透明与适应性有助于保护弱势个体；因此，LLMs适合用于法律理论验证与行政支持。

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

TL;DR: 本文提出一套面向结构化数据的世界建模模式，通过DOM转导和超媒体可供性识别，使代理能高效构建、动态扩展其内部世界模型，从而实现可扩展、自适应和互操作的Web自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立软件代理的可操作内部世界模型，以便从结构化数据（如DOM和Web服务语义描述）中提取对推理和决策有用的表示，解决原始HTML冗长难以直接输入大模型以及API集成静态导致适应性差的问题。

Method: 设计并描述两种模式及其组件与数据流：DOM转导用于提取紧凑表示，超媒体可供性识别用于解析标准化语义描述动态扩展能力；说明模式如何与推理核心和执行器接口，以及如何保持模型更新和可互操作性。

Result: 提出了两种架构模式：DOM转导模式（将冗长的DOM蒸馏为紧凑、任务相关的世界模型）和超媒体可供性识别模式（在运行时解析语义描述，发现并集成未知Web服务能力）。

Conclusion: 组合使用这两种模式，可以工程化地为代理提供高效、可维护和可扩展的世界建模能力，支持跨网页和扩展资源的自动化任务。

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They study surrogate gradient slope effects in SNNs, find adaptive/shallow slopes help especially in RL, and introduce a privileged guiding policy bootstrapping method achieving strong drone control results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: enable efficient neuromorphic controllers and bridge SNN training gaps in RL

Method: systematic analysis

Result: adaptive slope schedules + privileged guiding policy greatly improve performance; 2.1x improvement and real-world drone results

Conclusion: Combined adaptive slope schedule and privileged guiding policy enable effective training of SNNs for real-world robotic control, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段的成本高效管道：先用跨任务示例和LLM对少量目标实例进行伪标注，再用图传播将标签扩散到剩余实例，最终用完整的伪标注数据构造ICL示例，从而减少对LLM标注的依赖并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量示例收集成本高、耗时。希望减少对LLM查询和人工标注的依赖，同时仍能为ICL提供有效示例。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 用跨任务示例提示LLM，对少量目标任务实例进行伪标注；2) 构建图并采用基于图的标签传播，将标签扩散到未标注样本，从而得到完整伪标注集，随后用其构建in-task示例进行ICL。

Result: 在五个任务的实验证明该管道在降低标注成本的同时仍能取得强性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在五个任务上表现良好，能在大幅降低标注成本的同时维持强竞争力的ICL性能。

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成方法在真实环境下难以产出高质量、多回合的数据，受限于目标化训练、工具架构隔离和多回合逻辑依赖三大问题；需要新的框架来解决这些结构性缺陷。

Method: 构建Environment-API Graph交互采集轨迹；Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis构造高质量查询；Guided Iterative Chain用于复杂的Chain-of-Thought多回合生成。

Result: FunReason-MT: a framework to synthesize multi-turn function-calling training data for LLMs, focusing on real-world environments.

Conclusion: FunReason-MT能稳定生成高质量、多回合、具逻辑依赖的函数调用数据，推动小模型在BFCLv3/v4上达成或超越现有同规模模型性能。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Build tool and document knowledge graphs, fuse them, and use deep-sparse integration to generate better exemplar plans for tool-augmented reasoning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tools have rich schemas but lack domain procedural grounding; documents/SOPs contain procedures but not tool semantics; fusing both yields better plans

Method: Construct fused tool-document knowledge graphs and deep-sparse integration for exemplar plan generation

Result: Framework builds tool graph from schemas, document graph from SOPs, fuses them, uses deep-sparse alignment to produce exemplar plans; experiments show improved modeling of tool interactions and plan quality

Conclusion: Linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs enables more accurate tool interaction modeling and improved exemplar artifact/plan generation

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.
