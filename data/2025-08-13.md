Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI是一个结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列的深度学习框架，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起。

Method: ImageDDI通过将分子分解为功能基序序列，并结合全局分子图像信息（如纹理、颜色等），使用基于Transformer的编码器和自适应特征融合技术。

Result: 实验表明，ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过结合局部和全局结构信息，显著提升了DDI预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量激增，但资源受限的设备难以运行深度学习模型，现有研究忽视了TinyML环境中的优化挑战。

Method: 详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并探讨了理论与实践的结合。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，用于优化混合光学神经网络（ONNs）的性能，通过神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）缩小与电子教师网络的差距，并在制造后微调数字后端以提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受到训练精度差距和模拟与实际系统差异的限制。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的管道，结合NTKD技术，在训练和制造后阶段优化ONNs性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证了管道的有效性，显著提升了ONNs的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为ONNs的实用部署提供了有效解决方案，适用于预制造模拟和实际实现。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频故事，通过多阶段协作和3E原则提升视频质量、辅助能力和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: MAViS采用多智能体协作框架，分阶段完成脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模、关键帧生成、视频动画和音频生成，并遵循3E原则（探索、检查和增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和视频表现力方面达到最先进水平，并能生成高质量的长序列视频故事。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个提供多模态设计输出的框架（带叙事和背景音乐的视频），为用户提供了丰富的创意支持。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装虚拟试穿框架，通过扩散模型联合建模上下服装和个人身份，显著提升了真实感和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖复杂预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：GRM（服装表示模块）、PRM（个人表示模块）和A-DiT融合模块，通过扩散变压器整合服装、个人和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CObL是一种基于扩散模型的架构，用于从图像中推断出遮挡有序的对象层堆叠，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡和深度。

Method: 使用扩散模型（CObL）并行生成对象层堆叠，利用Stable Diffusion作为自然对象的先验，并通过推理时间指导确保层堆叠复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界桌面的照片，处理不同数量的新对象。

Conclusion: CObL在无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量的情况下，能够重建多个遮挡对象，且不限于训练时的世界。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型在长篇幅叙事理解中表现不足，特别是在因果推理和角色一致性方面。研究提出新评估框架，揭示了模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前视觉语言模型在表面识别与深层叙事推理之间的关键差距，特别是在处理连续视觉叙事时的不足。

Method: 通过结合细粒度多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，系统性地分析了视觉语言模型的局限性。具体包括：(i) 通过对齐轻小说文本的标注协议，(ii) 多推理范式的综合评估，(iii) 跨模态相似性分析。

Result: 研究发现，当前模型在生成性叙事、上下文对话基础和时序推理方面表现不佳，缺乏真正的故事级智能。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在长篇幅叙事理解方面存在显著不足，特别是在非线性叙事、角色一致性和跨面板因果推理方面。本研究为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于降噪低剂量儿科X射线，同时保留诊断相关特征，显著提升肺炎分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量儿科X射线在资源匮乏地区是早期诊断的关键工具，但降噪方法常会损害关键解剖细节，影响诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，自适应平衡噪声抑制与结构细节保留，并通过模拟噪声数据解决训练数据稀缺问题。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在资源匮乏环境中具有显著的诊断价值，能够高效降噪并保留关键细节。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

### [10] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需访问模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，激活导向向量需要侵入式运行时访问，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。

Method: 通过设计通用导向图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像性能接近导向向量，且对负面导向效果更佳。

Conclusion: VISOR重新定义了多模态模型控制方式，揭示了视觉导向攻击的安全漏洞，亟需防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [11] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用平行文本行图像和距离目标函数，提升近代日本文献OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献转录耗时且数据稀缺，影响OCR系统训练。

Method: 提出基于距离的目标函数，最小化平行图像对的自注意力特征差距，探索欧氏距离和MMD作为域适应指标。

Result: 实验显示，CER分别降低2.23%和3.94%，自注意力表示质量提升。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升历史文献OCR性能。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [12] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种自适应校准模块，通过ViT的CLS令牌学习实例级温度，显著降低校准误差，且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，但现有方法（如温度缩放）需要验证集且仅使用全局标量。

Method: 提出CalAttn模块，直接从ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度，无需额外验证集。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率校准，同时保持准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，通过多样教师模型和标签传播解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习和领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法难以同时解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多样教师模型生成可靠伪标签，结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架能有效应对多种半监督学习场景，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性问题，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在盲脸恢复中存在与高质量图像和合成图像之间的差距，无法直接适应真实世界的复杂退化。

Method: 使用FLIPNET网络，在恢复模式中逐步整合BFR特征和面部嵌入，在退化模式中合成真实世界退化图像。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，并能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过双模式设计有效解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 框架实现了对视频元素的灵活组合，生成高质量且可控的视频。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提升了泛化能力，并生成更可解释的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升多模态大语言模型文档理解可解释性和适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: 解决DETR-based方法中随机初始化查询缺乏明确语义的问题，以提升HOI检测性能。

Method: 提出了QueryCraft框架，结合了ACTOR和PDQD模块，通过跨模态Transformer和感知蒸馏查询解码器生成语义丰富的查询表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过引入语义先验和引导特征学习，显著提升了HOI检测的性能，并在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Conclusion: TransMiter 是一种轻量级适配器，能够在不使用反向传播的情况下提升视觉语言模型的性能，同时保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance artistic expression and image correction by integrating neural artistic style transfer with color transfer algorithms, benefiting fields like art, design, and film.

Method: The methodology involves using KL divergence to evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms (Reinhard global color transfer, IDT, IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA) between original and style-transferred images, along with estimating color channel kernel densities.

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of KL divergence in quantitatively evaluating various color transfer algorithms for style-to-content transfer, providing insights into their performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining neural artistic style transfer with color transfer algorithms, evaluated using KL divergence, provides a robust method for enhancing artistic expression and image correction.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Result: HVPL模型在避免灾难性遗忘方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL模型通过帧级和视频级的创新设计，有效解决了视频实例分割中的类别遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PADReg是一种基于接触力引导的物理感知变形配准框架，通过结合接触力和超声图像信息构建刚度图，显著提高了超声图像配准的准确性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度、高噪声和模糊组织边界使得变形配准极具挑战性，现有方法在解剖对齐和物理可解释性方面表现不佳。

Method: 利用机器人超声系统测量的同步接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，并通过轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 在体内数据集上，PADReg的HD95达到12.90，比现有最优方法提高了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理先验，显著提升了超声图像配准的性能和解剖对齐效果，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提高了检测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测的边界模糊，现有方法依赖多模态融合（RGB和LiDAR），但计算成本高且不适合实时应用。

Method: 使用预训练的Vision Transformer提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量级解码器，避免依赖LiDAR数据。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法实现了高效且实时的越野自由空间检测，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 研究团队创建了首个带状伪影视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding，并提出了一种高效的无参考视频质量评估工具CBAND，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频在压缩过程中产生的带状伪影严重影响观看体验，尤其是在高端HDTV或高分辨率屏幕上。现有数据集仅限于静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态，因此需要系统性研究带状伪影的视频质量评估问题。

Method: 研究团队创建了首个开放视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding，包含160个视频，并收集了7,200条主观评价。基于此，他们提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估工具CBAND，利用深度神经网络嵌入的自然图像统计特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CBAND在感知带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快。

Conclusion: CBAND是一种高效且有效的无参考视频质量评估工具，其性能显著优于现有最先进模型，并且速度更快。此外，CBAND还可作为可微分损失函数用于优化视频去带模型。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有调试框架在修复视觉识别模型时因分布偏移和语义错误而难以有效修复的问题。

Method: 使用条件文本到图像模型生成语义忠实且目标明确的图像，并通过LVLM过滤生成的样本以确保其与原始数据分布一致且语义一致。

Result: 实验表明，这种有针对性的修复策略在不引入新错误的情况下显著提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过引入一个可解释的失败归因流程和条件文本到图像模型，结合大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）过滤生成的样本，该方法显著减少了与罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标，显著提升了晶状体结构分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络在交叉熵损失下对所有像素平等加权，忽略了晶状体子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。专家注释时对不同子区域赋予不同置信度，这启发了ACW损失的设计。

Method: ACW损失通过置信度阈值将晶状体子区域分为高低置信度组，并应用区域加权损失。还设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法和BECE指标。

Result: 在AS-OCT数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，U-Net下IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW损失和BECE指标有效利用了专家注释的置信度先验，显著提升了晶状体结构分割的性能。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交媒体视频共享管道的框架，通过估计压缩和调整大小参数来生成平台特定的伪影，从而提升深度伪造检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台上的专有压缩技术导致深度伪造检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，而直接复制这些转换又因API限制和数据共享约束难以实现。

Method: 通过从少量上传视频中估计压缩和调整大小参数，构建本地模拟器，大规模生成平台特定的伪影数据。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，且检测器在模拟数据上微调后的性能与真实共享媒体训练相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度伪造检测器在压缩视频内容领域的实际部署提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新基准，用于评估复杂场景下基于自然语言的3D检索能力，实验显示现有模型在细粒度检索上仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统在简单场景下表现良好，但在复杂场景（如杂乱环境中的模糊描述）中表现不足，因此需要新的基准来推动技术进步。

Method: 提出了ROOMELSA基准，包含1,600多个公寓场景、5,200多个房间和44,000多个目标查询，用于评估系统在复杂场景中基于自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力。

Result: 实验表明，尽管粗粒度对象检索已基本解决，但只有少数模型能在所有测试案例中始终排名第一。轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在材料、部件结构和上下文线索的细微变化上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA 通过整合视觉和语言理解，为复杂场景下的3D检索系统设立了新基准，推动了现实世界3D识别系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计因物种形态多样性和数据稀缺而更具挑战性，传统热图回归方法效果有限。

Method: 提出DiffPose-Animal框架，将姿态估计重构为扩散模型的去噪过程，结合LLM提取的文本先验与图像特征融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在物种多样性和遮挡场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过生成式框架和语义引导，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化忽略了纹理变化，导致质量下降且增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导比特分配。

Result: 在基准测试中，RPO-AdaSharp在感知增强和比特率节省方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp通过区域自适应方法在视频锐化和比特率优化方面表现出色，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态变化下表现不佳，常产生不自然的过渡和遮挡区域重建不准确的问题。

Method: 提出了一种双向变形模型，结合刚性和非刚性变换，建立了观察空间和规范空间之间的连续可逆映射。通过参数化的表面-时间空间（u, v, t）捕捉非刚性运动，并引入一致性损失抑制变形引起的伪影和不连续性。

Result: 在 ZJU-MoCap 和 MonoCap 数据集上的实验表明，该方法在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF 在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法，实现了更好的关节对齐、纹理保真度和结构连续性。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Result: 生成了一个公开数据集，可用于跨年龄人脸识别和合成图像检测的基准测试。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式能有效解决类别表示与图像特征不对齐问题，且无需额外架构修改即可应用于现有方法，显著提升了轻量级语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多概念LoRA模块组合时存在身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题。

Method: 引入token mask和训练目标，约束模块关注特定token并对齐空间注意力。

Result: 实验表明TARA能高效多概念推理并保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免模块间干扰，实现了高效的多概念生成。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and

*Noor Ahmed,Cameron Braunstein,Steffen Eger,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DFroMLLM是一个无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令的框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成3D对象原型，并在图像分类和细粒度视觉语言任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理方面表现有限，需要一种能够直接从MLLMs生成3D对象原型的解决方案。

Method: 提出3DFroMLLM框架，包含设计师、编码器和视觉检查器，通过迭代优化生成3D原型。

Result: 生成的图像在图像分类任务中性能提升15%，在细粒度视觉语言任务中CLIP的准确率提升55%。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM展示了直接从MLLMs生成3D原型的潜力，并在多个任务中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [43] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）新框架，通过各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量实现高质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估图像质量时缺乏对不同失真类型的分类和量化能力，需要一种更鲁棒的双重用途工具。

Method: 定义ATR度量，使用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制，并通过两阶段系统（分类和回归）实现失真类型识别和质量评分。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关性分别达到-0.93和-0.95，分类准确率超过97%，整体系统R2为0.892。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像失真分类和量化方面表现出高预测准确性，是一种鲁棒的双重用途工具。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的自适应高频预处理框架，通过FFPN预测最优预处理策略，平衡视频压缩后的码率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码码率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练网络，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该框架能显著提升视觉质量并节省码率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了主观质量提升和码率节省的有效平衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate为动态场景的新视角合成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数自动化肿瘤分割和报告生成的研究集中在术前数据，而术后影像分析的研究较少。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net架构训练分割模型（术前肿瘤核心、术后残留肿瘤和切除腔），并使用DenseNet进行MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别。

Result: 分割模型的平均Dice分数为87%（肿瘤核心）、66%（非增强肿瘤核心）、70%（增强残留肿瘤）和77%（切除腔）；分类模型的平衡准确率为99.5%（MR序列分类）和80%（肿瘤类型分类）。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了自动化分割、分类和标准化报告生成，符合RANO 2.0指南，提升了术后评估和临床决策的效率。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于伪全局信息引导机制和流形适应的新型跨视图网络，显著提升了LiDAR场景识别在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合机器人超声和实时形状补全的新系统，显著提升了脊柱超声成像的实时性和可视化效果，并通过实验验证了其准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合傅里叶特征编码和选择性体素采样的结构无关神经压缩方法，显著提高了压缩效率和训练速度，同时保持了较高的压缩质量。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Conclusion: 通过高效的提示工程，可以充分利用基础模型的内置多模态知识。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Result: Lay2Story在一致性、语义相关性和美学质量上优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 布局条件能有效提升故事生成的一致性和控制精度，Lay2Story框架和数据集为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Result: 实验表明TCSSM在跨域CDVQA任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM和BrightVQA数据集为跨域CDVQA研究提供了有效工具，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing

### [57] [TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08978)
*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，在去噪后期高效加速，显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于缓存的视频扩散模型加速方法通常在早期或中期跳过去噪步骤，导致结构不一致，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: TaoCache采用固定点视角预测模型的噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似性和噪声增量的范数比，在去噪后期阶段特别有效。

Result: 在Latte-1、OpenSora-Plan v110和Wan2.1等框架中，TaoCache在相同加速条件下，视觉质量显著优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: TaoCache在保持高分辨率结构的同时，实现了高效的加速，显著提升了视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR），优于现有的缓存方法。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐，开发了ColorGPT管道，在颜色建议准确性和多样性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色推荐方法因设计复杂性和数据限制表现不佳，研究探索LLMs是否能成为更优的设计工具。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，通过系统测试颜色表示和提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板完成和生成。

Result: ColorGPT在颜色建议准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，在完整调色板生成任务中也提升了颜色多样性和相似性。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中表现出色，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLMs在压缩视频帧时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息丢失。

Method: 提出KFFocus方法，结合经典视频压缩原理识别关键帧，并根据上下文相关性分配不同的压缩比例，同时引入时空建模模块。

Result: 在广泛认可的视频理解基准测试中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频帧压缩策略和引入时空建模模块，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性，尤其在长视频场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前运动表示方法无法从多尺度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: MSQ通过不同编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部位，并在时间维度上插值编码特征为多尺度，然后量化为离散标记。

Result: MSQ在多个基准测试中优于现有基线方法，支持无缝组合运动标记而无需专门设计或重新训练。

Conclusion: MSQ通过多尺度量化方法有效解决了运动表示的局限性，提升了运动生成和编辑的能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大核卷积网络（ConvNets）虽然有效感受野大，但参数量和计算成本高，且ERF的渐近高斯分布（AGD）易被破坏。

Method: 通过组合小核（如7×7、9×9、11×11）扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上优于现有CNN和ViT，UniConvNet-T达到84.2%准确率，UniConvNet-XL达到88.4%。

Conclusion: 组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD是一种高效且有效的方法，UniConvNet在多种任务和规模下均表现优异。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Retinex方法在分解光照和反射组件时存在互组件残差（ICR），这些残差不仅影响分解准确性，还导致增强结果偏离理想效果。

Method: 提出了一种新的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），在分解阶段使用互组件残差减少模块，在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，IRetinex在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，提出的IRetinex模型在低光图像增强任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 解决现有半监督方法过度依赖学生模型和忽略模型认知偏差的问题，同时提升伪标签生成的置信度。

Method: 提出了一种不确定性感知的交叉训练框架（UC-Seg），包含两个子网络，采用交叉子网一致性保持（CCP）策略和不确定性感知伪标签生成（UPG）组件。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态（如MRI、CT、超声等）的分割任务中，UC-Seg表现出优于其他先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: UC-Seg框架通过引入不确定性感知的交叉训练策略，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的准确性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法依赖标记数据，但随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需利用大规模未标记数据的方法。

Method: 提出DPGNet，包含文本引导的跨域对齐模块（统一视觉和文本嵌入）和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块（动态利用未标记样本），并通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上实验表明，DPGNet优于现有方法6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过结合跨域对齐和伪标签生成，有效解决了深度伪造检测中标注数据不足的问题，展示了未标记数据的潜力。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Result: 在SimplerEnv中，任务解决率比SpatialVLA提高了4%，比TraceVLA提高了19%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量训练数据下即可实现性能提升，适用于数据收集困难的现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features - previously designed to capture identity - and show how they can
be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the benefit
that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods, and
several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应阈值和人机协作，有效提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失有效提升了开放集感知能力，验证了方法的先进性和有效性。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了生物识别系统的安全性，还为理解欺骗攻击的行为模式提供了新见解，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

*Ya Zou,Jingfeng Yao,Siyuan Yu,Shuai Zhang,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Turbo-VAED的低成本解决方案，用于将视频VAE高效迁移到移动设备，显著减少参数数量和延迟，并保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频VAE在移动设备上存在内存不足和推理速度慢的问题，需要一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析冗余架构、引入3D深度可分离卷积、提出解耦的3D像素洗牌方案，并设计了一种高效的解码器训练方法。

Result: Turbo-VAED在720p分辨率下将原始VAE加速84.5倍，参数减少82.5%，重建质量保留96.9%，并在iPhone 16 Pro上实现2.9倍FPS提升。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现了移动设备上的实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公开高质量全人体捕捉数据集缺乏的问题，以推动重光照和新视角渲染技术的研究。

Method: 通过收集多视角单光源（OLAT）捕捉的全人体数据，包括HDR RGB帧，涵盖多种光照条件（如白光、环境光、颜色渐变和精细OLAT光照）。

Result: HumanOLAT数据集成为首个公开的大规模多视角OLAT全人体捕捉数据集，评估显示现有技术在复杂人体外观和光照交互建模方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT数据集填补了公开高质量全人体捕捉数据的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源，促进了人体特定和通用重光照与渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

Motivation: 金融论证质量评估研究不足，LLM在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的一致性和对抗性别偏见攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: LLM标注一致性高于人类，但存在不同程度的性别偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在金融论证标注中具有潜力，但需改进偏见问题，未来研究应关注可靠性和成本效益。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学网络话语检测任务（CheckThat! 2025 Task 4a）中的挑战，即识别推文中是否包含科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 委员会辩论在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在认知共情和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的能力。

Method: 使用标准化的心理学测试，比较小型和大型语言模型与人类在认知和情感共情任务中的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情方面显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情方面表现出色，适合提供客观的情感支持，但情感共情能力仍需提升。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于新闻监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻网站通常将新闻按主题组织成故事，但现有方法（如聚类或主题建模）无法基于特定事件、地点和人物进行分组。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream、TextClust），提取特定事件和命名实体。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体1个月的新闻数据集上验证，人工评估显示方法有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能实时将新闻文章分配到特定故事，效果良好。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床语言模型在处理冗长、非结构化的电子健康记录（EHRs）时，往往难以提供可信赖的预测和解释。

Method: 通过领域感知关键词蒸馏和大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理，TT-XAI 提高了分类性能和可解释性。具体包括将原始出院记录蒸馏为简洁的关键词表示，并使用关键词引导的提示生成链式临床解释。

Result: 所有评估方式（基于删除的保真度指标、LLaMA-3 自评和专家盲法研究）均显示关键词增强方法表现更优，蒸馏提升了机器和人类可解释性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI 提供了一种可扩展的途径，用于在临床决策支持中实现可信且可审计的人工智能。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM是一个新的数学推理基准，包含522个大学竞赛题目和100个变体，用于评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力，避免训练数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理基准的准确率接近饱和，且存在训练数据污染问题，需要更动态、抗污染的评估方法。

Method: 从Putnam数学竞赛中选取522个题目，并生成100个变体，通过扰动变量和常量创建无限难度的新实例。

Result: 最强模型在原始集上准确率为41.9%，但在变体集上下降19.6%，表明模型存在记忆问题。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一个动态、抗污染的评估框架，适用于评估大型语言模型的高级数学推理能力。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了巨大影响，需要自动化的检测方法。现有黑盒模型缺乏解释性。

Method: 使用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，通过大语言模型将文本映射到形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器进行下游任务。

Result: 在五个多语言数据集上平均macro-F1为0.69，优于现有方法，且融合形容词表示后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词表示是一种紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方式，适用于仇恨言论识别及其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在持续指令调优中缺乏严格和系统基准的问题。

Method: 通过结合最终答案准确性和细粒度的CoT推理质量评估，以及系统比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式（强化学习与监督微调）。

Result: 发现包括：模型通用能力越强，持续学习中的遗忘鲁棒性越高；推理链比最终答案退化更慢；持续学习算法的效果高度依赖模型能力和任务顺序；在强化学习中，KL散度约束有助于保持策略稳定性并减轻遗忘。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为多模态大语言模型的持续指令调优提供了严格的评估标准，并为算法设计和评估提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型和视觉语言模型中因果相关单元的定位方法，验证对比定位器的有效性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用，比较不同单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器衍生的单元对心理理论任务的影响更大。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性受到质疑，需要更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务特定单元捕捉方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Conclusion: MinionsLLM框架在多智能体控制中表现优异，开源资源支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility

Conclusion: 总结了并行文本生成的最新进展、开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现ROUGE在幻觉检测评估中表现不佳，建议采用语义感知的评估框架以提高LLM输出的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管存在多种幻觉检测方法，但其评估通常依赖于ROUGE，这种基于词汇重叠的指标与人类判断不一致，导致性能估计误导。

Method: 通过全面的人类研究，比较了ROUGE和人类对齐指标（如LLM-as-Judge）在幻觉检测方法评估中的表现。

Result: ROUGE的召回率高但精确度极低，导致性能估计不准确；简单的启发式方法（如基于响应长度）可以与复杂检测技术相媲美。

Conclusion: 采用语义感知和鲁棒的评估框架对于准确衡量幻觉检测方法的真实性能至关重要，从而确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为FiqhQA的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在伊斯兰教法领域的准确性和可靠性，特别关注不同教派和语言的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在宗教领域（尤其是伊斯兰教法）的可靠性，填补现有研究在教派区分和语言多样性上的空白。

Method: 方法包括设计FiqhQA基准，进行零样本和弃权实验，评估LLMs在不同教派和语言中的表现。

Result: 结果显示GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在弃权行为上更优；所有模型在阿拉伯语中表现下降。

Conclusion: 结论强调在宗教应用中需谨慎部署LLMs，并需进行任务特定评估。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，提升教学适应性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现成的LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、缺乏对学生不确定性的适应性和易受情绪操控提示影响。

Method: 通过CoT数据增强和针对性对话设计，优化LLMs的响应，并微调开源模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在教学指导、推理支持和抗干扰方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CoDAE框架有效提升了LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和教学效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中表现不佳，需要提升其对领域知识的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用Prior Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID)生成高质量推理数据集，并结合Molecular Iterative Adaptation (MoIA)训练策略，迭代结合监督微调(SFT)和强化策略优化(RPO)。

Result: Mol-R1在基于文本的分子推理生成任务中表现出优于现有基线的性能。

Conclusion: Mol-R1框架通过PRID和MoIA策略显著提升了R1类长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现形态对齐对性能有适度正面影响，但分词算法对下游任务影响更大，Unigram分词器表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究形态对齐的分词方法是否提高语言模型性能，尤其是在形态复杂的语言中。

Method: 通过从分词器训练到微调和下游任务评估的全面实验，评估了形态对齐和分词质量对性能的影响。

Result: 形态对齐与性能呈适度正相关，但分词算法对性能影响更大；Unigram分词器在多数情况下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对基于语法的任务（如词性标注、命名实体识别和依存句法分析）有适度正面影响，但分词算法（如BPE与Unigram）对下游性能的影响更大。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用特定token logits在生成过程中联合生成并忠实归因答案的方法，显著提升了RAG中的忠实性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐token生成与归因生成方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1) 用特定token标识标记文档，并利用这些token的logits估计文档对答案的贡献；(2) 将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于现有方法，同时表现出低延迟和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LoDIT通过联合生成和归因，有效提升了RAG的忠实性和效率，为LLM的可信度问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

TL;DR: 提出了两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入边界目标和选择性更新机制，显著提升了小型LLM在资源受限情况下的对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距较大时难以对齐人类偏好，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero两种方法，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中提升了2.0%的胜率和1.4%的长度控制胜率；在MT-Bench中表现出色，尤其在STEM和人文任务中。

Conclusion: 简单的偏好目标修改可以显著提升小型LLM的对齐效果，为高效部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于跨文档共指消解（CDCR）的记录链接方法，结合自然语言推理（NLI）和语义文本相似性（STS），在流程工业中显著提升了事件日志的关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程工业中的事件日志记录分散，导致相关记录（如设备问题及解决方案）无法有效关联，阻碍了知识管理。

Method: 将记录链接问题建模为CDCR任务，结合NLI和STS，并引入因果推理（CI）进行增强。

Result: 提出的RL模型在性能上分别比NLI和STS基线高出28%（11.43分）和27%（11.21分）。

Conclusion: 通过领域适配和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可有效提升流程工业中数据质量和日志关联性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型隐藏状态的变化规律，以提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析20个开源Transformer模型，结合隐藏状态变化率和模型对下一个token的确定性，提出类似能量的守恒量，并推导出Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 发现随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地守恒“能量”，训练使模型进入更快、更果断的状态。Jacobian steering在测试模型中保持能量恒定，并生成语义质量更高的输出。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角研究Transformer模型，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于提升模型的预测性和与人类意图的一致性。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化的用户偏好。

Method: 提出了一种基于少样本比较回归的可引导多元化模型，利用上下文学习和细粒度属性进行对齐选择。

Result: 该方法在Moral Integrity Corpus和HelpSteer2数据集上表现优异，优于多个基线方法和最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元化对齐提供了新见解，推动了伦理AI的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 开发一种通用且高质量的令牌压缩方法，以减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪训练生成压缩表示，并对编码器进行小规模修改以优化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩下指标仅略有下降，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中节省显著，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏大规模、高质量的数据集，阻碍了相关研究的发展。

Method: 使用3,699篇自传体叙事构建数据集，开发了DepressLLM模型，并引入SToPS模块提升性能。

Result: DepressLLM在AUC上达到0.789，高置信度样本（≥0.95）的AUC提升至0.904。

Conclusion: DepressLLM展示了可解释AI在抑郁症早期诊断中的潜力，为精神病学领域的医学AI提供了前景。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Method: 综述通过系统分析LoRA变体、合成数据生成、用户反馈集成等方法，评估其对计算效率、检索精度和语言真实性的影响。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA适配显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成质量，但在保留语言细节和实时反馈方面仍有局限。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在特定领域语言任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适配和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Method: 通过自动化代理工作流和手动验证协议快速开发了包含1000多个多样化任务环境的框架，支持自动生成训练/测试用例和集成验证模块。

Result: 前沿模型在许多推理任务中表现不佳，但通过InternBootcamp训练可以显著提升性能，32B模型在Bootcamp-EVAL和其他基准测试中取得了最优结果。

Conclusion: InternBootcamp 是一个有效的开源框架，通过任务扩展（task scaling）显著提升了大型语言模型在多样化推理任务中的性能，其32B模型在Bootcamp-EVAL和其他基准测试中达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Result: IFRAgent在人类意图对齐率上平均提升6.79%（相对提升32.06%），在步骤完成率上平均提升5.30%（相对提升26.34%）。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过结合显式和隐式意图流，显著提升了移动代理与人类意图的对齐率，并提高了任务完成率。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

TL;DR: A novel LLM-driven system improves text-to-table generation via task decomposition and iterative self-feedback, showing strong results but with computational trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure, long inputs, and numerical reasoning, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: The system uses novel prompting techniques, breaking the task into guided sub-tasks and refining tables through iterative self-feedback.

Result: The method outperforms baselines on two complex text-to-table datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates strong performance in text-to-table generation by leveraging task decomposition and iterative self-feedback, though it highlights trade-offs between performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言翻译中的性能不足问题，利用其在高资源语言翻译中的优势生成目标端文本。

Method: 提出TopXGen方法，生成高质量、主题多样的目标端文本，并通过反向翻译创建平行数据。

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLM在微调和上下文学习中的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen是一种有效的方法，能够生成高质量数据，提升低资源语言翻译性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Conclusion: 现代ASR模型在现实数据上表现良好，但需注意幻觉导致的高WER问题。

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: IROTE通过自我反思优化，解决了LLMs在特质激发中的浅层和不稳定问题，实现了更精确和一致的表现。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Conclusion: Magical通过创新的架构设计，有效解决了异构数据下的医学通俗语言生成问题，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured

critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在RAG系统中使用私有知识图谱（KGs）时存在隐私风险，匿名实体导致语义丢失，传统RAG系统无法有效检索。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，将匿名实体转换为可检索信息，并优化问题与KG的对齐。

Result: 在三个数据集上，ARoG表现出色且具有隐私鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了匿名实体检索问题，同时保护隐私，为隐私保护的RAG系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

Motivation: 现有RL框架在工具使用方面缺乏高效训练环境和可验证奖励机制。

Method: 采用场景分解、文档生成、函数集成、复杂度扩展和本地化部署构建训练环境，并设计可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模LLMs的工具使用性能，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文理解和推理能力，该方法有效提升了LLMs的工具使用性能。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因训练数据固定而导致的知识过时和时间泄漏问题。

Method: 通过预训练一组基于不同时间段的GPT风格专家模型，并使用TiMoE（时间感知的混合语言专家）在推理时屏蔽未来时间段的专家，确保严格的时间有效性。

Result: 实验表明，TiMoE在八个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准测试中表现优异，匹配或超过最佳单时间段专家模型，并将未来知识错误减少高达15%。

Conclusion: 模块化、时间分段的预训练与因果路由结合是一种简单而有效的方法，可以使大语言模型在保持时间准确性的同时不牺牲整体性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

Motivation: 传统方法难以全面评估LLMs的数学推理能力，因此需要一种新方法来测试其对非数学扰动的敏感性。

Method: 创建PutnamGAP数据集，包含数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目，评估18个商业和开源LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 多数模型在变体题目上性能下降，如OpenAI的O3模型在核心变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性问题，为提升其数学推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中编码的偏见和刻板印象对于制定有效的缓解策略至关重要，但这些偏见行为往往难以隔离和分析。

Method: BiasGym包含BiasInject（通过基于标记的微调注入偏见）和BiasScope（利用注入信号识别和引导偏见行为组件）。

Conclusion: BiasGym在减少现实世界刻板印象和探索虚构关联方面表现出色，适用于安全干预和可解释性研究。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Sqator的自动评分工具，用于评估放射科报告的QA分数，通过细粒度文本分析实现高效且准确的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QA评分过程依赖资深医生，劳动密集且可能存在偏差，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级和资深报告之间的修订文本跨度，计算重要性分数并合并为最终QA分数。

Result: 在12,013份放射科报告上的实验表明，Sqator能提供竞争性QA分数，且修订跨度的重要性评分与资深医生判断一致。

Conclusion: Sqator是一种高效且准确的自动化QA评分工具，可减轻资深医生负担并减少评分偏差。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Method: 提出Culturescope方法，利用修补技术提取文化知识，并引入文化扁平化评分来衡量内在文化偏见。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在其文化知识空间中编码了西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据有限而偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来研究减轻文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的自回归解码方式导致推理延迟高，部分输出段具有并行化潜力。

Method: 提出ASPD框架，包括自动提取并行结构和混合解码引擎，实现串并行模式无缝切换。

Result: 在多个任务上实现最高3.19倍加速（平均1.85倍），生成质量差异小于1%。

Conclusion: ASPD为低延迟应用（如客服机器人）设定了高效并行推理的新基准。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline combining weak supervision and fine-tuning achieves top results in Arabic ASR, addressing data scarcity and dialect diversity.


<details>

Motivation: Developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic is challenging due to limited labeled data and linguistic complexity from diverse dialects.

Method: A scalable training pipeline involving pretraining on weakly labeled speech (15,000 hours) followed by supervised fine-tuning with a mix of filtered weakly labeled data and high-quality annotated data.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning effectively addresses data scarcity in low-resource languages, achieving state-of-the-art results in Arabic ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention比现有方法提升KV暴露1.6倍，准确率21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention通过动态修正注意力输出，显著提升了长序列解码的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

Result: 在CharacterEval、CharacterBench和CharacterArena上的实验表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性并显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena为强化学习在主观任务中的应用提供了更稳健和公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

Result: 在XNLI、IndicXNLI等任务上显著超越基线，低资源语言如Sinhala准确率从71.66%提升至75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言LLM提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的路径，提升了低资源语言的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: AutoCodeGen提出了一种自动化生成多语言代码生成数据集的方法，解决了现有基准测试的局限性，并推出了AutoCodeBench系列基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试依赖人工标注且多集中于Python，难以扩展和覆盖多语言及高难度任务。

Method: 通过LLMs生成测试输入，利用多语言沙箱获取测试输出，结合逆向问题生成和多步过滤确保数据质量。

Result: AutoCodeBench包含3,920个问题，覆盖20种编程语言，评估显示先进LLMs仍难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成提供了有价值的资源，鼓励社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Motivation: 低资源语言如Sinhala常被开源大语言模型忽视，需要专门支持。

Method: 增强LLM分词器，加入Sinhala词汇，并在1000万Sinhala语料上持续预训练。

Result: SinLlama在指令微调后，在文本分类任务中显著优于Llama-3-8B及其指令变体。

Conclusion: SinLlama是首个明确支持Sinhala的开源解码器LLM，表现优异。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注独立任务，无法捕捉现实场景中的长期上下文依赖和多交互协调。

Result: OdysseyBench有效挑战了最先进的LLM代理，提供了更准确的复杂场景评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench将成为推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中开发和评估的重要资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在逻辑丰富的指令上的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证的指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能正确遵循不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑丰富的指令遵循能力上存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）中的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了中间预测信息，而研究发现正确结果常出现在中间步骤但被后续步骤覆盖，因此需要利用时间动态信息。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票：训练自由的测试时解码策略；2) 时间一致性强化：使用时间语义熵（TSE）作为奖励信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%，结合准确性奖励后在其他数据集上也有显著提升。

Conclusion: 时间动态信息在dLLMs中具有巨大潜力，本文方法为利用这些信息提供了简单有效的工具。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

TL;DR: SafeKV是一个隐私感知的KV缓存管理框架，通过选择性共享非敏感条目和隔离敏感内容，有效减少侧信道攻击，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局KV缓存共享加速LLM推理，但会引发时序侧信道攻击，现有防御方法性能下降显著。

Method: SafeKV结合混合检测管道、统一索引和熵监控，实现细粒度隐私控制和高缓存重用效率。

Result: SafeKV减少94%-97%的侧信道攻击，提升TTFT性能40.58%，吞吐量提升2.66倍。

Conclusion: SafeKV在保持高性能的同时，为LLM推理提供强大的运行时隐私保障。

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IC伪装技术主要关注局部门修改，缺乏全面的欺骗策略，难以应对物理逆向工程攻击。

Method: 使用AIG-VAE编码电路表示，结合功能保留和外观模仿的双层伪装，并引入新型伪装门（如假反相器、假缓冲器等）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持电路功能的同时，实现了高伪装和相似性评分，且结构开销最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为硬件安全中的模仿欺骗设定了新标准，有效保护关键系统免受逆向工程威胁。

Abstract: Integrated circuits (ICs) are essential to modern electronic systems, yet
they face significant risks from physical reverse engineering (RE) attacks that
compromise intellectual property (IP) and overall system security. While IC
camouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches
largely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive
deception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning
(ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception
principles to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel
And-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit
representations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional
preservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert
gates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our
methodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while
presenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while
achieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural
overhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against
advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its
practical applicability in securing IC designs. By bridging the gap in mimetic
deception for hardware security, our work sets a new standard for IC
camouflage, advancing the application of cyber deception principles to protect
critical systems from adversarial threats.

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

We then present a novel detection method using low-level storage and memory
behavioral features and network traffic features obtained from a thin

Conclusion: 本文通过引入低级别行为对抗样本的概念，研究了如何生成最优的规避性勒索软件源代码，并通过实验验证了攻击者如何通过微行为控制功能降低勒索软件检测器的检测率。

Abstract: Protecting state-of-the-art AI-based cybersecurity defense systems from cyber
attacks is crucial. Attackers create adversarial examples by adding small
changes (i.e., perturbations) to the attack features to evade or fool the deep
learning model. This paper introduces the concept of low-level behavioral
adversarial examples and its threat model of evasive ransomware. We formulate
the method and the threat model to generate the optimal source code of evasive
malware. We then examine the method using the leaked source code of Conti
ransomware with the micro-behavior control function. The micro-behavior control
function is our test component to simulate changing source code in ransomware;
ransomware's behavior can be changed by specifying the number of threads, file
encryption ratio, and delay after file encryption at the boot time. We
evaluated how much an attacker can control the behavioral features of
ransomware using the micro-behavior control function to decrease the detection
rate of a ransomware detector.

Motivation: 现有DP-DBSCAN算法在发布聚类标签时缺乏实用性，因此需要一种更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于跨度的DP-DBSCAN定义，并开发了一个线性时间的算法，支持纯差分隐私下的直方图构建。

Result: 算法在理论和实验中均表现出色，提供了夹逼质量保证，并在实际数据集中验证了性能。

Conclusion: 基于跨度的DP-DBSCAN定义和算法在实用性和隐私保护之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP).
Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input
points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach
cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an
alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that
publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and
classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm
achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as
matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our
algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under
pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of
our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员、工程师和政策制定者提供了可操作的指导，旨在开发既稳健安全又符合伦理且公众可信的AI系统。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has expanded its capabilities across domains, yet
introduced critical technical vulnerabilities, such as algorithmic bias and
adversarial sensitivity, that pose significant societal risks, including
misinformation, inequity, security breaches, physical harm, and eroded public
trust. These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We
propose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal
dimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security
(system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and
Social Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach
unifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights
to promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a
systematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1)
the generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2)
inadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3)
fragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings
stem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational
design principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address
the interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome
this, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor
with social responsibility. Our framework offers actionable guidance for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers to develop AI systems that are not
only robust and secure but also ethically aligned and publicly trustworthy. The

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

Method: 结合深度学习、信息论和密码学，研究互信息估计器在检测选择性加密图像泄露中的应用。

Result: 研究表明，互信息估计器能够捕捉加密表示中的空间依赖性和残余结构，为图像信息泄露估计提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides
robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same
feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require
regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive
information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones
by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily
through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and
alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for
introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable
secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special
attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in
private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance,
Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines
further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the
future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant,
trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.

*Jiaxuan Wu,Yinghan Zhou,Wanli Peng,Yiming Xue,Juan Wen,Ping Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EditMF是一种无需训练、高效且隐蔽的指纹嵌入方法，用于保护大语言模型的知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于后门的方法在隐蔽性和效率上存在不足，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 通过加密的人工知识库映射所有权位，利用因果追踪和零空间更新嵌入指纹。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上表现出高隐蔽性和低性能损失，验证仅需单次黑盒查询。

Conclusion: EditMF是一种高效、低开销的安全LLM所有权验证方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

Motivation: 电网数字化和物联网设备的普及增加了电网对网络攻击的脆弱性，尤其是负载改变攻击（LAA）可能导致电网不稳定。

Method: 使用英国国家电力系统运营商发布的GB-36 Zone模型，通过DIgSILENT PowerFactory进行仿真，评估LAA的阈值和BESS的缓解效果。

Result: 分析了LAA的严重性阈值、BESS与LAA的相对位置影响，以及攻击延迟对系统响应的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为电网运营商提供了关于LAA影响的实用见解，并展示了BESS在缓解攻击中的潜力。

Abstract: The growing digitalization and the rapid adoption of high-powered
Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices (e.g., EV charging stations) have
increased the vulnerability of power grids to cyber threats. In particular, the
so-called Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) can trigger rapid frequency fluctuations
and potentially destabilize the power grid. This paper aims to bridge the gap
between academic research and practical application by using open-source
datasets released by grid operators. It investigates various LAA scenarios on a
real-world transmission network, namely the Great Britain (GB)-36 Zone model
released by the UK's National Electricity System Operator (NESO). It evaluates
the threshold of LAA severity that the grid can tolerate before triggering
cascading effects. Additionally, it explores how Battery Energy Storage Systems
(BESS) based fast frequency response services can mitigate or prevent such
impacts. Simulations are conducted using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to ensure
realistic system representation. The analysis provides several useful insights
to grid operators on the LAA impact, such as the influence of the relative
locations of BESS and LAA, as well as how delays in attack execution can
influence the overall system response.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

Result: 证明了ICL估计器在条件概率估计中达到最优速率，且MLP在特定条件下也能实现类似性能。

Conclusion: ICL在多类分类中具有理论最优性，且不仅限于transformer架构，MLP也能实现类似效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

Motivation: 解决复杂模型在医学影像中可解释性不足的问题，特别是高相关性数据下现有方法效果不佳的挑战。

Result: 在 ADNI 和 TDBRAIN 数据集中，Hierarchical-CPI 优于现有方法，识别出生物学上合理的变量。

Conclusion: Hierarchical-CPI 是一种有效的模型无关变量重要性度量方法，能够处理高相关性数据，并在神经影像数据中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

Result: PC提供了一种基于局部信息的权重更新方法，具有自动梯度缩放等理论优势。

Conclusion: PC是一种有前景的生物可信学习算法，未来可能在神经网络训练中替代BP。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

Motivation: 电商搜索引擎通常仅依赖产品标题进行排名，但标题信息不足可能导致相关性预测不佳。产品描述虽更丰富，但冗长不适合实时排名。

Method: 提出ReLSum框架，利用强化学习生成优化的产品描述摘要，结合LLM和交叉编码器排名模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，离线指标（如召回率和NDCG）和在线用户参与度均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电商系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的搜索相关性增强方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

Motivation: 现有用户画像方法过于简化，无法捕捉长短期偏好的动态交互。

Method: 提出LLM-TUP方法，利用LLM生成用户历史的自然语言表示，并通过BERT编码和注意力机制动态融合长短期偏好。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LLM-TUP显著优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP通过结合时间感知的用户画像和LLM生成的语义丰富用户表示，显著提升了基于内容的推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

Motivation: 传统用户画像方法难以捕捉用户偏好的时间动态性（如短期兴趣和长期偏好），因此需要探索LLMs在此领域的潜力。

Method: 通过将时间偏好作为动态用户上下文，LLMs被用于生成语义丰富且时间感知的用户画像，并评估其在推荐系统中的表现。

Result: LLMs在用户交互历史丰富的领域（如电影和电视）表现显著，但在稀疏领域（如视频游戏）改进有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在增强用户画像方面具有潜力，但其效果高度依赖于数据集的特性和用户交互的丰富程度。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

Conclusion: 自适应个性化策略能显著提升对话信息检索系统的性能，未来可进一步优化个性化需求的识别。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web
regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality
evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge
graph endpoints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法忽视了路线局部质量和候选路线之间的比较，而这些对提升推荐性能至关重要。

Method: CCN模型结合查询级、项目级和比较级特征，通过综合比较块（CCB）和多场景MLP进行路线比较和评分。

Result: 离线与在线实验表明，CCN显著提升了路线推荐性能，并具备强解释性。

Conclusion: CCN已在Amap应用中稳定部署一年以上，为路线推荐提供了显著优化。

Abstract: Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的离线评估框架，通过用户画像提升播客推荐的可解释性和评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线指标存在曝光偏差，而在线A/B测试成本高且操作受限，因此需要一种可扩展且可解释的评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段的用户画像感知方法，首先从90天的收听历史中构建自然语言用户画像，然后利用这些画像为LLM提供上下文，使其能够更有效地评估推荐内容与用户兴趣的匹配度。

Result: 在47名参与者的对照研究中，该框架能够高保真地匹配人类判断，并优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的变体。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为离线评估者的新框架，能够高效且可解释地评估播客推荐质量。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

### [163] [Mitigating Popularity Bias in Counterfactual Explanations using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08946)

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型过滤用户历史记录的方法，以生成更符合用户偏好的反事实解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法容易产生偏差，可能不符合用户实际偏好。

Method: 在生成解释前，利用大语言模型过滤用户历史记录中的不相关项。

Result: 在公开数据集上测试，该方法生成的反事实解释更符合用户的流行偏好。

Conclusion: 通过预过滤步骤，可以显著提升反事实解释与用户偏好的对齐程度。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) offer a tangible and actionable way to
explain recommendations by showing users a "what-if" scenario that demonstrates
how small changes in their history would alter the system's output. However,
existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that
might misalign with the user's actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a
pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter
out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments
on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to
ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that
are more closely aligned with each user's popularity preferences than ACCENT
alone.

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过动态离散兴趣空间和概率兴趣模块，实现了从被动匹配到主动探索的检索范式转变，显著提升了业务指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多兴趣检索方法存在兴趣静态不变、缺乏主动探索新兴趣的问题。

Method: 使用RQ-VAE构建离散兴趣空间，并结合概率兴趣模块实现软搜索策略。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示用户观看时长增加0.9%，页面浏览量增加0.4%，PV500提升22.7%；离线评估指标Recall@K和NDCG@K也有提升。

Conclusion: SPARC框架在动态兴趣建模和主动探索方面表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

TL;DR: SCOPE利用离散余弦变换（DCT）减少游戏状态输入空间，通过稀疏化和截断保留关键特征，显著提升进化方法在游戏中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏状态空间大导致进化方法收敛慢，需减少输入空间维度以提升效率。

Method: 使用DCT将输入状态转换为系数矩阵，稀疏化和截断后通过CMA-ES算法学习策略。

Result: 在Space Invaders游戏中，SCOPE比未修改输入状态的进化方法和简单强化学习方法表现更好。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过减少输入空间维度，有效提升了进化方法在游戏中的性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成式AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建LLM的新组合结构，证明了LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，缺乏基于范畴论的组合结构探索。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）设计新型LLM架构，并通过理论验证LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴是完备的且构成拓扑，为新型架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论构建的LLM架构具有理论支持，为未来生成式AI设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

Result: 证明了TCMs范畴的完备性，展示了子对象分类器如何形式化因果干预，以及指数对象如何支持因果等价类的推理。

Conclusion: TCMs（拓扑因果模型）通过利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象），为因果推断提供了新的理论框架。这些性质使得复杂因果图的求解、干预操作的形式化以及因果等价类的推理成为可能。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于具有相似适应度景观的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Motivation: To address the barrier of requiring specialized statistical expertise for specifying prior distributions and likelihoods in Bayesian inference.

Method: Introduces LLM-BI, a pipeline for automating Bayesian workflows, and validates it through two experiments on Bayesian linear regression.

Result: LLMs can successfully elicit prior distributions and specify entire model structures from natural language descriptions.

Conclusion: LLMs can automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling an automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在用户提供的信息不完整或不明确时，回答的准确性和可操作性较差。

Method: 提出FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，并结合用户反馈优化回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上比基线提示高出40%，且稳定性优于上下文增强提示。

Conclusion: FATA通过增强用户参与和问题完整性，显著提升了LLMs的回答质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Motivation: 当前评估方法存在不足，无法区分模型是通过推理还是直接检索回答问题，且评估指标和答案匹配标准不一致。

Method: 提出了一种通用的基准构建方法和评估协议。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失情况下推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的评估方法和改进的KG-RAG设计以提高推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

Method: 从一个开放权重的大型语言模型出发，使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调技术对标注的选牌日志数据集进行训练。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce
$\textit{UrzaGPT}$, a domain-adapted large language model that recommends
real-time drafting decisions in $\textit{Magic: The Gathering}$. Starting from
an open-weight LLM, we use Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of
annotated draft logs. With this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities
of LLM, and can quickly adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark
$\textit{UrzaGPT}$ in comparison to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art
domain-specific model. Untuned, small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely
unable to draft, but the larger GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of
$43\%$. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of
$66.2\%$ using only 10,000 steps. Despite this not reaching the capability of
domain-specific models, we show that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and
conclude that using LLMs can enable performant, general, and update-friendly
drafting AIs in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中节点选择的时间复杂度较高（O(log N)），而传统队列的OPEN列表仅为O(1)，因此需要优化这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用双层MCTS，在每个叶节点上运行带扩展预算的最佳优先搜索，并结合树折叠技术减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的摊销O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的节点选择效率问题，为大规模规划问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

Motivation: 传统方法在编译过程中会生成所有组合并通过部分评估丢弃不必要的组合，这在大多数组合无关的问题中效率低下。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算生成最终约束集所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了将高级用户模型转换为求解器就绪形式的效率，特别是在变量范围大且有选择性前提条件的情况下。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill 通过解耦预填充和解码阶段，优化了大型语言模型的推理效率，显著提升了生成质量，同时减少了训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理阶段面临高成本问题，尤其是解码阶段对长序列的延迟影响较大。当前模型对预填充和解码阶段采用统一处理，未能充分利用其不同的计算特性。

Method: 提出 OverFill，将预填充和解码阶段解耦：预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换到密集剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B-to-1B 配置比 1B 剪枝模型性能提升 83.2%，8B-to-3B 配置比 3B 剪枝模型提升 79.2%，且性能与从头训练的相同规模模型相当。

Conclusion: OverFill 通过优化计算资源分配，显著提升了模型推理效率和生成质量，同时减少了训练数据需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [176] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，用于解决触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP），通过混合整数规划和多邻域局部搜索，在60秒内取得了接近最优解的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TSP无法处理动态变化的弧成本，而TA-TSP能够模拟仓库操作等实际场景中的状态依赖旅行成本。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索，使用混合整数规划将TA-TSP转化为一系列定制的TSP实例，并应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate算子进行改进。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例中，平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%；在合成数据集上，比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 该算法在MESS 2024中排名前三，适用于具有状态依赖旅行成本的实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [177] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出序数反馈无法恢复最优模型，提出基数反馈方法并通过实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序数比较的LLM对齐技术存在根本性限制，无法解决模型间的权衡问题，因此需要更高质量的反馈数据。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于基数反馈的偏好微调方法，并通过收集和公开25,000个基数判断的数据集来验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，引入基数反馈的模型在Arena-Hard等下游任务中表现优于仅依赖序数反馈的方法。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，仅依赖序数反馈的算法无法系统性地恢复最优模型，而引入基数反馈（如支付意愿）可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管POMO在组合问题中表现良好，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 改进POMO，利用初始节点更智能地寻找解决方案。

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上验证，POMO+收敛更快且结果更优。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合优化问题提供了进一步的研究方向。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工验证本体对齐的高质量对应关系成本高，尤其是在大规模本体中，因此探索LLM作为替代方案的可行性。

Method: 在OAEI的多个匹配任务中，使用不同本体驱动的提示模板评估多个先进LLM的性能，并与模拟Oracle进行比较。

Result: LLM在验证不确定对应关系时表现出潜力，性能与模拟Oracle的可变错误率进行了对比分析。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，用于验证本体对齐中不确定的对应关系，但仍需进一步优化和验证。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

*Yuchen Li,Cong Lin,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Philip Bontrager,Jialin Liu,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM是一个基于视频游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和问题解决能力，揭示了其在空间推理和基本规划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试大多缺乏对空间推理和规划能力的评估，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用General Video Game AI框架，通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景，定义可解释的指标（如有效步骤比率、步骤效率等）进行评估。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和规划任务中表现不佳，存在空间和逻辑错误。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为研究语言模型能力提供了可复现的测试平台，但当前模型仍需改进。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和全面评估框架。

Method: 提出SynLLM框架，使用20种开源LLM（如LLaMA、Mistral等），设计四种提示类型（如示例驱动、规则约束），结合结构化提示生成数据，并建立多维度评估流程。

Result: 在三个公共医疗数据集上测试，规则提示在隐私与质量间取得最佳平衡，LLM生成的合成数据具有临床合理性和隐私保护性。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明通过精心设计的提示和全面评估，LLM可生成高质量、隐私安全的合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性差，现有监督学习方法在零样本泛化方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出无监督网格适应方法，结合局部几何特征学习和M-Uniform损失函数。

Result: 实验表明UGM2N在多种PDE和网格几何上表现优越，具有可扩展性和无网格纠缠的误差减少。

Conclusion: UGM2N在网格适应中实现了方程无关的泛化和几何独立性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: AgriGPT是一个专为农业设计的LLM生态系统，通过多代理数据引擎和Tri-RAG框架提升推理可靠性，显著优于通用LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏领域特定模型、精选数据集和鲁棒评估框架，LLMs在农业中的应用受限。

Method: 设计了多代理可扩展数据引擎，构建了高质量标准化QA数据集Agri-342K，并采用Tri-RAG框架结合密集检索、稀疏检索和多跳知识图谱推理。

Result: AgriGPT在领域适应和推理方面显著优于通用LLMs，并提供了AgriBench-13K作为评估基准。

Conclusion: AgriGPT提供了一个模块化和可扩展的LLM生态系统，为农业领域提供了结构化数据构建、检索增强生成和领域特定评估的通用框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而遇到性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化属性，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 实验显示，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间和85%的基础文件大小。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，能够显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化资源利用和提升诊断信心，为临床决策提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: LLMs在增强训练环境中的反馈和自动化评估方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳，且输出冗长，主要依赖链式推理，而其他拓扑结构可能更有效。

Method: 提出TopoAug合成数据管道增强训练多样性，结合监督微调和强化学习，并引入Frugal Learning减少输出长度。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理显著提升模型性能，同时优化输出效率，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于社会认知理论的LLM社交代理框架，包含动机、行动规划和学习模块，显著提升了行为的真实性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交代理缺乏统一框架，难以泛化到不同社交场景并产生一致、真实的行为。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，设计了包含动机、行动规划和学习模块的系统化框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在复杂条件下能重现真实人类行为模式，偏差比基线降低75%。消融研究证实各模块对行为真实性的关键作用。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架能有效提升LLM社交代理的行为质量，为通用社交代理设计提供了系统化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于记忆增强的AR代理框架，用于个性化任务辅助，通过学习用户长期经验来提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在复杂多步骤场景中表现不足，无法利用用户长期交互历史进行推理。

Method: 框架包含四个模块：感知、记忆、时空推理和执行器，支持多模态数据处理和上下文合成。

Result: 提出了实现路线图、评估策略和应用案例，展示了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动更智能的AR系统发展，结合用户历史与自适应任务辅助。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的新型分类法，用于更全面地理解知识编辑领域，分析了不同知识类型的编辑效果，并总结了现有方法的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有研究多关注编辑机制，而忽略了知识的功能性分类，因此需要一种更全面的视角。

Method: 论文采用了一种基于功能和机制的双轴分类法，对知识编辑领域进行了系统性的综述。通过分析不同知识类型的编辑效果，论文评估了现有方法的适用性和局限性。

Result: 论文提出了基于功能的新型分类法，并分析了不同知识类型的编辑效果。通过系统性综述，论文总结了现有方法的优缺点，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的新型分类法，以更全面地理解知识编辑领域。通过分析不同知识类型（如事实性、时间性、概念性、常识性和社会性知识）的编辑效果，论文总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且解释评估缺乏统一标准和资源。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，一个可重用软件资源，通过模块化设计实现解释评估的标准化流程。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化，并提供了模块化和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释评估的空白，提供了一个可重用、模块化的软件资源，支持从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent是一个新型的多模态检索增强生成（mRAG）框架，通过动态规划和工具感知执行序列优化工作流，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的mRAG方法存在检索策略僵化和视觉信息利用不足的问题，限制了其在实时场景中的应用。

Method: E-Agent采用一次性mRAG规划策略，结合动态工具编排和任务执行序列优化，减少冗余工具调用。

Result: 在RemPlan和其他基准测试中，E-Agent比现有方法准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过创新的规划和执行机制，有效解决了mRAG系统的动态性和效率问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在情感识别方面的能力，并与人类表现对比。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力。

Result: MLLMs个体表现优于人类，但人类集体智慧及人机协作表现最佳。

Conclusion: 人机协作是发展情感智能AI的最有前景路径。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双代理混合框架，通过分离推理和代码生成任务，减少认知干扰，提升数学推理系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单代理范式，导致推理和代码生成任务之间的认知负载干扰。

Method: 提出双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成和执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理设计显著减少了认知干扰，提升了推理和代码生成的协调性。

Conclusion: 分离推理和代码生成任务的双代理框架能有效提升数学推理系统的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,

involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We pro- pose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learn- ing with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a spe-
cially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with dif- ferent difficulty
distributions for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually
released and the training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show
that Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal

vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the

Method: 设计了三阶段实验，基于经济问卷，提出更通用的评估框架，结合认知标记的概率值分析其对LLMs决策的影响。

Result: 前景理论在LLMs决策建模中并不总是可靠，尤其是当不确定性以多样化的语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了前景理论在LLMs应用中的局限性，为未来研究提供了新的评估框架和实验方法。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

Motivation: 大语言模型可能放大有害偏见，传统方法（如数据过滤或后处理）将模型视为黑箱，缺乏直接干预。

Method: 1. 训练线性探测器识别模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算引导向量，通过实时干预减少偏见输出。

Result: 在GPT2-large上验证，探测器能高精度识别偏见，引导向量成功将偏见输出转向中立。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可解释的大语言模型提供了直接且可复现的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，FiXGBoost在大规模真实数据集上表现良好，能够有效预测请求前等待时间。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost模型在预测乘客请求前的等待时间方面表现出色，并具有高解释性，为共享出行系统的优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于深度神经网络的预测性维护框架在CVCM故障分类中表现出色，具有高准确性和早期检测能力，且可扩展至其他铁路系统。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Result: SMA首次实现了对图像检索痕迹的成员推断，并能够准确区分生成内容的来源。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，从‘是否记忆数据’转向‘内容来源何处’。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: OpenCUA是一个开源框架，用于扩展CUA数据和基础模型，性能超越现有开源和部分商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于商业CUA系统的封闭性，研究社区需要开放框架以研究其能力、局限性和风险。

Method: 提出了OpenCUA框架，包括注释基础设施、AgentNet数据集和可扩展的演示转换管道，支持长链思维推理。

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified基准测试中达到34.8%的平均成功率，优于开源模型和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OpenCUA框架通过开源工具、数据集和模型，为计算机使用代理（CUA）研究提供了开放基础，并在性能上超越了现有开源模型和部分商业模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

*Xianghe Pang,Shuo Tang,Rui Ye,Yuwen Du,Yaxin Du,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowseMaster是一个可扩展的框架，通过规划器-执行器代理对实现高效信息检索，解决了现有LLM代理在搜索广度和推理深度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代理在信息搜索中存在搜索广度不足和推理深度受限的问题，导致多步推理的连贯性被破坏。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，采用规划器制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索，两者协同工作以保持连贯的长时推理和广泛的探索。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优异，分别获得30.0和46.5的分数，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂、需要深度推理的信息搜索任务中表现出色，解决了现有代理的局限性。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

TL;DR: EndoAgent是一种新型AI代理，通过双记忆设计和统一推理循环提升内窥镜诊断能力，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模预训练方法在多任务协调和复杂临床工作流程的多步骤处理上表现不足，AI代理在内窥镜领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了EndoAgent，一种基于双记忆设计的视觉到决策的内窥镜分析代理，结合了迭代推理和自适应工具选择与协作。

Result: 实验表明，EndoAgent在视觉理解和语言生成任务上优于通用和医学多模态模型，展示了其强大的灵活性和推理能力。

Conclusion: EndoAgent通过双记忆设计和统一推理循环，显著提升了内窥镜图像诊断的灵活性和推理能力，优于现有的通用和医学多模态模型。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: LLMs在将弗吉尼亚17-18世纪土地专利描述转换为地理坐标方面表现出色，优于传统方法，且成本效益高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如叙述性边界描述）限制了空间分析，需要更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: 使用六种OpenAI模型（o-series、GPT-4-class、GPT-3.5）在两种范式下测试：直接转换和工具增强的链式思考。

Result: 最佳模型（o3-2025-04-16）平均误差23公里，优于其他模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理参考中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Conclusion: Doctor Sun通过改进的多模态训练方法，提升了医学AI在复杂任务中的表现，并开源资源推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种无需训练的高效神经网络设计方法，以解决传统深度学习中过度参数化和资源消耗的问题。

Method: 使用遗传算法来识别随机初始化神经网络中的高性能子网络，避免了传统训练和模型压缩的需求。

Result: 在二元和多类分类任务中，该方法在准确性和稀疏性上优于现有技术，且无需梯度信息。

Conclusion: 该论文通过遗传算法成功识别了强彩票假设中的高性能子网络，在无需梯度信息的情况下，优于现有方法，并强调了在复杂网络架构中评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算系统中的去中心化联邦学习（DFL）面临通信瓶颈、资源异构性和数据异构性等挑战，需要一种高效且成本效益的解决方案。

Method: 提出Hat-DFed框架，将拓扑构建建模为双优化问题，设计两阶段算法动态优化通信拓扑，并引入重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: Hat-DFed在复杂边缘环境中能够最大化模型性能并最小化累积能耗，同时缓解数据异构性带来的性能下降。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的DFL提供了一种高效且成本效益的解决方案，解决了资源异构性和数据异构性的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变而具有挑战性，尤其是在多站点场景中需要同时建模时空动态。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应下采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势和周期成分，并通过交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet显著优于现有基线方法，验证了其在时空分布时间序列预测中的有效性。

Conclusion: XFMNet通过逐步多模态融合和递归建模，成功提升了多站点水质预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Motivation: 由于时间序列数据对噪声敏感且存在序列依赖性，导致域偏移问题，传统深度学习方法性能下降。

Method: 提出MoSSDA框架，包括域不变编码器和混合增强正对比模块，采用两阶段学习过程分离梯度流。

Result: 在六个数据集上，MoSSDA在三种不同骨干网络和不同未标记比例下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和各模块的有效性，显著提升了半监督域自适应任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，为缩放点积注意力机制（SDPA）提供了理论依据，揭示了其前向传递与熵最优传输问题的联系，以及反向传递与策略梯度的数学等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SDPA机制通常由启发式方法驱动，缺乏严格的数学基础。本文旨在从优化角度为其提供理论支持。

Method: 将SDPA的前向传递建模为退化的一侧熵最优传输问题，并证明反向传递的标准梯度与基于优势的策略梯度在数学上等价。

Result: 揭示了SDPA前向传递诱导的信息几何结构，证明了学习梯度的形式是该优化问题的自然结果。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种有原则的机制，前向传递执行最优推断，反向传递实现了基于流形感知的学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在系统异构性和通信效率方面存在不足，且未能充分利用模型预测的多样性。

Method: 提出SHEFL框架，根据客户端的计算能力分配不同数量的全局模型，并引入新的聚合方案以减少数据偏差。

Result: 实验表明，SHEFL在计算异构性、公平性和性能方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHEFL通过动态调整资源分配和引入新的聚合方案，有效解决了计算异构性问题，显著提升了公平性和整体性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MGSTC方法在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，其性能优于十一种最先进的基线方法，适用于连续预测场景。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Motivation: 利用离线数据优化在线遗憾最小化问题，特别是在已有大量离线数据的场景中。

Method: 使用扩展的D-optimal设计和分阶段消除策略，结合Frank-Wolfe近似优化。

Result: 在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，离线数据质量影响显著。

Conclusion: OOPE在离线数据质量不同时均表现最优，并通过优化进一步降低高维问题中的遗憾。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统入侵检测系统在性能上有提升空间，尤其是在联邦学习场景下，需要兼顾隐私和性能。

Result: FetFIDS在联邦学习环境中优于多种先进入侵检测系统，并表现出高度适应性。

Conclusion: FetFIDS通过特征嵌入和联邦学习显著提升了入侵检测性能，适合边缘计算部署。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have an increasingly important role in
preventing exploitation of network vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Recent
deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in
the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we
explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to
improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning
system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning
scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can
ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms
multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated
environment and demonstrates a high degree of suitability to federated
learning. The code for this work can be found at

*Muralikrishnna G. Sethuraman,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCCD-CONF是一种新颖的框架，用于在存在未测量混杂因子的情况下，通过干预数据学习非线性循环因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统（如生物网络）常违反传统因果发现算法的假设（所有变量可观测且因果图无环），现有方法在处理混杂因子时存在线性假设或可扩展性问题。

Method: DCCD-CONF通过交替优化图结构和估计混杂因子分布，最大化数据的对数似然。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据集上，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因子识别方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF不仅在实际应用中表现优异，还提供了理论一致性保证。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理条件和概率建模，显著提升了高光谱成像目标识别的解释性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Conclusion: MLP的显式通道混合有助于循环卷积网络学习更鲁棒和泛化的计算模式，对神经程序合成有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Motivation: 函数空间先验在BNNs中能更直观地嵌入先验知识，但实现困难。

Method: 使用优化技术研究可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）如何适应复杂先验。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐藏层的BNNs，配备灵活激活函数也能有效实现目标函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数是BNNs实现复杂函数空间先验的有效途径。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重能够有意义地融入所研究的XAI框架中，提升了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重可以有效地整合到可解释AI框架中，丰富了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Motivation: GNN在深度层中存在过平滑问题，现有方法在深层特征上表现不佳，而Mamba虽然能保留全局拓扑信息，但忽略了浅层细节。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含HAP模块（动态切换交叉注意力和Graph-Mamba投影器）和SAF模块（自适应融合多级特征）。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前SOTA方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层特征投影和融合，有效解决了全局-局部权衡问题，提升了分子表示学习的效果。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant computational costs of active testing that previously hindered its use for large models, especially LLMs.

Method: The approach uses in-context learning to cheaply construct a surrogate model for guiding data acquisition, avoids updating within the active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. It also introduces a single-run error estimator for real-time assessment.

Result: The proposed method enables more efficient evaluation of LLM performance with less data compared to standard practices.

Conclusion: Active testing can be effectively scaled to evaluate large language models (LLMs) with reduced computational costs and data requirements, outperforming current standard practices.

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架忽略了边缘客户端的计算异构性和资源受限设备的训练负担，且存在高通信成本和复杂模型聚合问题。

Method: 提出SHeRL-FL，结合分层模型聚合和表示学习，允许客户端和边缘服务器独立计算训练目标。

Result: SHeRL-FL在图像分类和分割任务中，数据传输量比集中式FL和HierFL减少90%以上，比SplitFed减少50%。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL通过结合分层模型聚合和表示学习，显著降低了协调复杂性和通信开销，并在实验中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

TL;DR: FPTM通过模糊子句评估机制，显著提升效率、减少资源需求，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准TM的“全有或全无”子句评估策略过于严格，需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确性，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种模糊模式的Tsetlin Machine（FPTM），其中子句评估是模糊的而非严格的，允许部分失败的子句仍能贡献投票。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM表现出色，例如在IMDb上仅需每类一个子句即可达到90.15%的准确率，训练速度提升316倍，内存占用减少50倍。

Conclusion: FPTM通过引入模糊评估机制，显著减少了所需的子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性，适用于在线学习和微控制器应用。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph

TL;DR: Oblivionis框架通过结合联邦学习和遗忘学习，解决了联邦LLM训练中数据隐私和合规性问题，实现了选择性数据删除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习框架缺乏内置机制满足GDPR等法规的遗忘权要求，且现有方法无法选择性删除客户端贡献。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，将联邦学习和遗忘学习统一为双重优化目标，整合6种FL和5种遗忘算法。

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis在遗忘效果和模型效用间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM提供了轻量级、合规的遗忘解决方案，为未来LLM发展指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Conclusion: FWPs为人工和自然智能的融合提供了新的视角，展示了动态权重变化在机器学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法缺乏对实际节点特征的支持，且难以生成真实且忠实的解释。

Method: 提出DiGNNExplainer，一种模型级解释方法，利用离散去噪扩散合成具有真实节点特征的异构图。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估表明，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer通过离散去噪扩散生成具有真实节点特征的异构图，提供了更真实且忠实于模型决策的解释，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的部分最优传输（POT）方法，通过二次正则化（QPOT）实现稀疏传输计划，解决了现有方法因熵正则化导致的密集性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入质量相等，而POT放宽了这一限制，但现有POT方法因依赖熵正则化导致传输计划密集，不适用于需要稀疏性的应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT方法（QPOT），以生成稀疏的传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集及实际应用（如颜色迁移和域适应）中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于多种需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Conclusion: 在异构计算资源环境中，通过引入可控偏差的本地SGD方法，可以显著加速训练，并达到与同步SGD相当的精度。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Conclusion: UQGNN通过结合多元扩散图卷积网络和交互感知时间卷积网络，显著提升了多变量时空预测的准确性和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 低秩训练方法通过矩阵分解减少可训练参数，但固定的低秩结构限制了权重矩阵的秩，可能阻碍模型学习复杂模式的能力。此外，训练过程中权重的有效秩会下降，低秩重参数化会加速这一现象。

Method: 提出了一种动态秩训练框架，通过在全秩训练和低秩训练之间交替进行，调整权重矩阵的秩以缓解训练过程中的秩崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 通过在全秩训练和低秩训练之间交替进行，可以有效恢复模型权重的秩，提出的动态秩训练框架在保持计算成本接近SVD低秩训练的同时，实现了与全秩训练相当的准确性。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏微调策略为专业分类任务提供了一种高效、低成本的小模型适配方案。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel OCIL method using a Global Workspace Model and multi-level distillation improves stability and plasticity, outperforming existing approaches under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces challenges in maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Current replay-based and ensemble methods are insufficient under these constraints.

Method: The approach enhances ensemble learning by fusing student model parameters into a shared GWM, which serves as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. A multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism enforces consistency among students and aligns them with the GWM.

Result: Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed method, utilizing a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and multi-level collaborative distillation, effectively balances stability and plasticity in OCIL, achieving significant performance improvements across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成采样方法提高了TSP求解器的分布鲁棒性，尤其在最坏情况下表现显著优于现有神经方法。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

*Shuyi Zhang,Wei Shi,Sihang Li,Jiayi Liao,Tao Liang,Hengxing Cai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARM是一种新型奖励模型架构，通过稀疏自编码器提升奖励模型的解释性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型缺乏解释性且难以适应用户偏好变化，多维奖励模型虽改进但仍存在不足。

Method: 结合预训练的稀疏自编码器，将隐藏激活映射到可解释的稀疏特征空间。

Result: SARM实现了奖励分配的透明化，动态适应偏好变化，且性能优于传统模型。

Conclusion: SARM为奖励模型提供了更高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFac框架通过从单一信息源提取差异化因子并强制一致性，提升半监督学习中的伪标签质量，结合多模态语言模型增强决策因子，显著提高低标签情况下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签确认偏差和训练崩溃问题，现有方法难以获取独立决策因子。

Method: 从单一信息源提取差异化因子，通过一致性约束和样本筛选优化伪标签，结合多模态语言模型引入辅助因子。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DiFac在低标签情况下表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子和一致性约束有效提升半监督学习性能，尤其在低标签情况下表现突出。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出开源模板，帮助AI系统满足欧盟AI法案的技术文档要求，确保透明性和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统文档模板未能完全覆盖AI生命周期，且不符合AI法案的技术文档要求。

Method: 引入开源模板和示例，用于记录数据、模型和应用，并通过用户反馈评估和优化这些模板。

Result: 模板在真实场景中验证有效，支持监管合规和负责任AI开发。

Conclusion: TechOps模板通过提供全面的技术文档，支持AI系统的透明性、可追溯性和合规性，为AI法案的实施提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Motivation: 电信网络中告警数量庞大且关系复杂，NOC工程师难以快速识别根告警，需要有效的告警关系学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为TempOpt的无监督告警关系学习技术，克服了现有时间依赖方法的局限性。

Result: 在真实网络数据集上的实验表明，TempOpt学习的告警关系质量优于时间依赖方法。

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习技术，适用于复杂电信网络环境。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Result: 在八个真实世界数据集上达到SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型（特别是WaveTS-M）在多通道时间序列预测中表现出色，显著提升了性能，同时减少了参数数量。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该论文通过提出一个系统化的框架，解决了生成式机器学习在设计表示和探索中的数据集需求大和可解释性差的问题，并通过实际应用验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Conclusion: APRNet在时间序列预测中表现出色，尤其在捕捉平稳信息方面。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 发现持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 强调持续学习模型的安全问题，需开发更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

Conclusion: LNN-PINN 提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进，显著提升了物理信息神经网络在复杂科学和工程问题中的预测准确性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，GenCast显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理原理，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测能力。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态力场驱动顶点组织，有效提升了分类边界清晰度和语义一致性，为图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，本文方法为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为边缘智能系统中的分层推理提供了高效且实用的解决方案，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet

simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

*Rylie Weaver,Massamiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry是一个用于生成图数据的库，用于测试和基准化GNN在手性预测中的能力。它生成具有特定几何和拓扑特征的合成图样本，并用于设计两种新的GNN架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN在手性预测中存在性能不足的问题，需要一个更可解释且减少混淆的基准测试工具。

Method: Chi-Geometry生成包含一个手性中心的合成图样本，并用于基准测试多种SOTA GNN架构。基于结果设计了两种新架构：一种通过全连接提高准确性，另一种通过虚拟节点保持线性计算成本。

Result: Chi-Geometry成功生成了用于基准测试的数据集，并指导设计了两种新GNN架构，分别在高准确性和计算效率上有所突破。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN在手性预测中的性能评估提供了有效工具，并推动了新架构的设计，兼顾了准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理和形式化语言的几何问题求解方法GF-Reasoner，通过混合推理轨迹和强化学习优化，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在几何问题求解中存在不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理的局限性，直接生成形式化程序缺乏中间推理过程。

Method: 结合Chain-of-Thought（CoT）与形式化语言，模型交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码，并通过监督微调和强化学习优化。

Result: GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准测试中提升了15%的准确率，推理轨迹更短且更清晰。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用高阶几何知识和符号计算卸载，为未来研究提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一种通用的神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集的特征依赖学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式，如不同的模式、不一致的语义和无固定特征顺序，这使得构建能够跨数据集利用信息的通用模型具有挑战性。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的置换不变Transformer和语义接地模块，利用自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例来学习跨数据集的特征依赖关系。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现出色，并支持在开放世界设置中成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景中因校准不佳可能导致严重后果，现有方法忽视了欠置信问题。

Result: 实验表明，MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了边缘计算中GPU资源利用不足的问题，通过多工具集成提供了NVIDIA Jetson设备在并发视觉推理任务中的资源行为视图，并提出了硬件感知优化的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备的普及和网络技术的发展，边缘计算对实时数据处理的需求增加，但GPU资源在边缘计算场景中的共享和利用不足，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过分析高、低层次指标（如GPU利用率、内存使用、SM利用率和张量核心使用），并结合多种分析工具的追踪数据，全面评估资源行为。

Result: 研究发现，尽管GPU利用率可达100%，但关键低层次资源（如SM和张量核心）的利用率仅为15%至30%，且CPU端事件（如线程调度和上下文切换）常成为性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 论文为NVIDIA边缘设备的视觉推理任务用户提供了关键观察结果，指导硬件感知优化以提高GPU性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

TL;DR: 论文首次对联邦学习在5G边缘场景中的吞吐量预测进行了全面基准测试，发现FedBN在非IID数据下表现稳健，LSTM和Transformer模型优于CNN，且LSTM在准确性、收敛速度和时间开销之间取得了最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G网络中，准确且自适应的吞吐量预测对延迟敏感和高带宽应用至关重要，但现有方法在异构移动环境中的非IID数据分布下适用性有限。

Method: 评估了三种联邦学习聚合算法（FedAvg、FedProx、FedBN）和四种时间序列架构（LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM、Transformer），使用五个真实数据集，分析了客户端异构性、队列大小和历史窗口长度的影响。

Result: FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健；LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上比CNN基线高出80%；Transformer收敛速度更快但需要更长历史窗口；FedBN-LSTM和Transformer在实时流媒体中分别将QoE分数提高了11.7%和11.4%。

Conclusion: 研究为下一代无线网络中构建可扩展、隐私保护和边缘感知的吞吐量预测系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该调度框架在策略设计、动态资源建模和多租户服务保障方面具有实用和工程价值，能有效提升复杂条件下分布式系统的调度效率和资源管理。

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案有效解决了资源瓶颈问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

TL;DR: 本文首次提出$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性条件下的去中心化梯度下降框架，在理论和实践中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的$L_0$-平滑性条件在现代任务（如深度学习）中过于严格，而$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性条件能够提供更好的收敛速率，但其在去中心化优化中的扩展尚未被探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于自适应剪裁的去中心化梯度下降方法，适用于$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性条件，无需预先知道$L_0$和$L_1$的值，也不依赖于梯度有界的假设。

Result: 在确定性设置中，该方法在凸/非凸函数上实现了已知最优的收敛速率；在随机设置中，推导了复杂度界限，并识别了凸优化中改进复杂度界限的条件。实证验证表明梯度范数依赖的平滑性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个在$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性条件下的去中心化梯度下降（DGD）通用框架，通过引入新的分析技术，在确定性和随机性设置下均取得了显著的收敛速率和复杂度界限，并通过实证验证了理论与实践的桥梁。

Abstract: $L_0$-smoothness, which has been pivotal to advancing decentralized
optimization theory, is often fairly restrictive for modern tasks like deep
learning. The recent advent of relaxed $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness condition enables
improved convergence rates for gradient methods. Despite centralized advances,
its decentralized extension remains unexplored and challenging. In this work,
we propose the first general framework for decentralized gradient descent (DGD)
under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness by introducing novel analysis techniques. For
deterministic settings, our method with adaptive clipping achieves the
best-known convergence rates for convex/nonconvex functions without prior
knowledge of $L_0$ and $L_1$ and bounded gradient assumption. In stochastic
settings, we derive complexity bounds and identify conditions for improved
complexity bound in convex optimization. The empirical validation with real
datasets demonstrates gradient-norm-dependent smoothness, bridging theory and
practice for $(L_0,L_1)$-decentralized optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 传统ESC方法通常仅保证指数稳定性，收敛速度较慢。本文旨在通过滑模技术改进ESC的收敛性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 结合滑模控制、有限时间和固定时间控制技术，提出了基于梯度和牛顿的ESC方案，利用正弦扰动信号和单位向量控制（UVC）估计未知二次非线性性能映射的梯度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于滑模技术的多变量极值搜索控制（ESC）新方法，通过引入不连续的“继电器型”控制组件，实现了比传统方法更快的收敛速度和更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient
convergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode
techniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and
more recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a
new framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based
ESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies
in the use of discontinuous "relay-type" control components, replacing
traditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic
nonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the
first attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes
within the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach,
the convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective
function. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by
employing a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a
Riccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the
closed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging
Lyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with
discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed
method, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness
compared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only
exponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based
method exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient
trajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the
Newton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall
performance going straightly to the extremum.

Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal
control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state
probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given
deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this
work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine
Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a
quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This
complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential
in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in
nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering
(transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic
scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process
noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing
medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections
between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the
lens of quantum mechanics.

periodically aligns states across timescales to maintain consistency and

this setup. Our framework is very generic, and covers a wide-spectrum of
applications.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多尺度联合边界控制和路径引导（MSJC）框架在大型网络中有效调节交通流量，提高了区域吞吐量。

Abstract: Perimeter control and route guidance are effective ways to reduce traffic
congestion and improve traffic efficiency by controlling the spatial and
temporal traffic distribution on the network. This paper presents a multi-scale
joint perimeter control and route guidance (MSJC) framework for controlling
traffic in large-scale networks. The network is first partitioned into several
subnetworks (regions) with traffic in each region governed by its macroscopic
fundamental diagram (MFD), which forms the macroscale network (upper level).
Each subnetwork, comprised of actual road links and signalized intersections,
forms the microscale network (lower level). At the upper level, a joint
perimeter control and route guidance model solves the region-based inflow rate
and hyper-path flows to control the accumulation of each region and thus
maximize the throughput of each region. At the lower level, a perimeter control
strategy integrated with a backpressure policy determines the optimal signal
phases of the intersections at the regional boundary. At the same time, a route
choice model for vehicles is constructed to meet hyper-path flows and ensure
the intra-region homogeneity of traffic density. The case study results
demonstrate that the proposed MSJC outperforms other benchmarks in regulating
regional accumulation, thereby improving throughput.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized online resource
allocation in the presence of Byzantine attacks. In this problem setting, some
agents may be compromised due to external manipulations or internal failures,
causing them to behave maliciously and disrupt the resource allocation process
by sending incorrect messages to their neighbors. Given the non-consensual
nature of the resource allocation problem, we formulate it under a primal-dual
optimization framework, where the dual variables are aggregated among the
agents, enabling the incorporation of robust aggregation mechanisms to mitigate
Byzantine attacks. By leveraging the classical Byzantine attack model, we
propose a class of Byzantine-resilient decentralized online resource allocation
algorithms that judiciously integrate the adaptive robust clipping technique
with the existing robust aggregation rules to filter out adversarial messages.
We establish theoretical guarantees, showing that the proposed algorithms
achieve tight linear dynamic regret and accumulative constraint violation
bounds, where the constants depend on the properties of robust aggregation
rules. Numerical experiments on decentralized online economic dispatch validate
the effectiveness of our approach and support our theoretical results.

Motivation: 市场分割问题作为线性系统与二元变量算法的基准问题，传统方法（如分支定界法）难以解决较大实例（如m=7），而新的GPU实现（Schroeppel-Shamir算法）可以解决m=11的实例。作者希望通过格问题的方法进一步提升解决能力。

Method: 作者将市场分割问题转化为格问题，并开发了一种新的算法实现。

Result: 作者的最新实现（Diophant）在标准计算机上可以解决QOBLIB中m=14的市场分割实例，优于传统方法和GPU实现的Schroeppel-Shamir算法。

Conclusion: 通过将市场分割问题转化为格问题，作者的方法显著提升了解决能力，能够处理更大的实例（m=14），为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The market split problem was proposed by Cornu\'ejols and Dawande in 1998 as
benchmark problem for algorithms solving linear systems with binary variables.
The recent (2025) Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library (QOBLIB) contains a
set of feasible instances of the market split problem.
  The market split problem seems to be difficult to solve with the conventional
branch-and-bound approach of integer linear programming software which
reportedly can handle QOBLIB instances up to $m=7$. In contrast, a new GPU
implementation of the Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm solves instances up to
$m=11$.
  In this short note we report about experiments with our algorithm that
reduces the market split problem to a lattice problem. The author's most recent
implementation solvediophant applied to the QOBLIB market split instances can
solve instances up to $m=14$ on a standard computer.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨SAVs与NVs共存时，不同定价策略对交通系统效率和财务可持续性的影响。

Method: 建立瓶颈模型，分析边际成本定价、平均成本定价和垄断定价三种策略下的均衡状态。

Result: 边际成本定价降低通勤成本但导致财务赤字；平均成本定价在适当时机实施可促进SAV采用并降低成本；道路扩容可能增加通勤成本。

Conclusion: 促进SAV采用并不总能降低社会成本，需结合定价和拥堵收费等政策优化社会成本。

Abstract: This study examines how scale economies in the operation of shared autonomous
vehicles (SAVs) affect the efficiency of a transportation system where SAVs
coexist with normal vehicles (NVs). We develop a bottleneck model where
commuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs,
and analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing,
average-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing
reduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service
provider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has
contrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the
existence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages
adoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV
adoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and
achieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that
expanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost
pricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems
with SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost,
including the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines
marginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that
relies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can
limit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that
promoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost.

Method: 通过迭代投影到变化的可行集上，利用投影的Lipschitz连续性性质，提出RPGD方法。

Result: 证明了RPGD在满足一定条件下收敛到约束均衡点，并通过数值实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RPGD在决策依赖优化问题中优于传统方法，确保了连续可行性并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: This paper considers the decision-dependent optimization problem, where the
data distributions react in response to decisions affecting both the objective
function and linear constraints. We propose a new method termed repeated
projected gradient descent (RPGD), which iteratively projects points onto
evolving feasible sets throughout the optimization process. To analyze the
impact of varying projection sets, we show a Lipschitz continuity property of
projections onto varying sets with an explicitly given Lipschitz constant.
Leveraging this property, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence
of RPGD to the constrained equilibrium point. Compared to the existing dual
ascent method, RPGD ensures continuous feasibility throughout the optimization
process and reduces the computational burden. We validate our results through
numerical experiments on a market problem and dynamic pricing problem.

Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal
objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the
case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes
computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent
heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the
computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many
heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several
special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a
constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when
the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the
heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting
Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is
bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local
controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride
behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the
monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of
the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class
of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.

Result: 建立了随机Oracle调用和通信轮数的上下界，与凸和鞍点优化问题的下界匹配。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了非光滑和随机优化理论，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study non-smooth stochastic decentralized optimization problems over
time-varying networks, where objective functions are distributed across nodes
and network connections may intermittently appear or break. Specifically, we
consider two settings: (i) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex
optimization, and (ii) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex-(strongly)
concave saddle point optimization. Convex problems of this type commonly arise
in deep neural network training, while saddle point problems are central to
machine learning tasks such as the training of generative adversarial networks
(GANs). Prior works have primarily focused on the smooth setting, or
time-invariant network scenarios. We extend the existing theory to the more
general non-smooth and stochastic setting over time-varying networks and saddle
point problems. Our analysis establishes upper bounds on both the number of
stochastic oracle calls and communication rounds, matching lower bounds for
both convex and saddle point optimization problems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the discrete-time asynchronous games in which
noncooperative agents seek to minimize their individual cost functions.
Building on the assumption of partial asynchronism, i.e., each agent updates at
least once within a fixed-length time interval, we explore the conditions to
ensure convergence of such asynchronous games. The analysis begins with a
simple quadratic game from which we derive tight convergence conditions through
the lens of linear control theory. Then, we provide a quasidominance condition
for general convex games. Our results demonstrate that this condition is
stringent since when this condition is not satisfied, the asynchronous games
may fail to converge. We propose both first- and zeroth-order learning
algorithms for asynchronous games, depending on the type of available feedback,
and analyze their last-iterate convergence rates. Numerical experiments are
presented on economic market problems to verify our results.

Conclusion: 本文提出的HC变换方法和LSILS框架在UBQP和TSP上表现出色，PC-LSILS进一步优化了算法性能，为组合优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对地形平滑技术在优化UBQP中作用的理解。

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Motivation: KV 缓存的读取延迟随上下文长度显著增加，影响长上下文 LLM 推理效率。现有方法（如 KV 逐出和 KV 检索）因令牌稀疏分布而表现不佳。

Method: Fier 使用 1-bit 量化键来估计每个令牌的重要性，实现高效且精确的 KV 缓存检索。

Result: 实验表明，Fier 仅使用 11% 的缓存预算即可匹配完整 KV 性能，解码延迟降低 1.2 倍至 1.5 倍。

Conclusion: Fier 是一种高效且精确的 KV 缓存检索方法，通过 1-bit 量化键估计每个令牌的重要性，显著提升了长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂且硬件环境快速变化，传统方法难以满足高效需求，因此需要跨栈优化。

Result: 提出了针对RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统的多种优化方案，显著提升了系统效率。

Conclusion: 跨栈优化是提升复杂ML系统效率的有效途径，未来可进一步探索更广泛的协同设计。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Conclusion: Tagore 是一个高效的 GPU 加速图索引库，能够显著提升高维向量空间中近似最近邻搜索的效率，同时保持索引质量。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

Result: 在多个SQL基准测试中，E3-Rewrite实现了高达25.6%的执行时间减少和24.4%的重写成功率提升。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite通过LLM和强化学习的结合，有效解决了传统规则方法的局限性，显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

### [294] [Experimental Validation of Provably Covert Communication Using Software-Defined Radio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08380)

TL;DR: 论文展示了使用软件定义无线电（SDR）实现可证明安全的隐蔽射频通信，验证了理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐蔽通信的理论研究已有十多年，但硬件实现和实验验证仍不足，尤其是射频领域。

Method: 使用软件定义无线电（SDR）进行实验验证。

Result: 成功实现了可证明安全的隐蔽射频通信，验证了平方根定律（SRL）。

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论预测，为隐蔽通信系统的实际应用开辟了道路，并提出了进一步的研究问题。

Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of
detection/intercept (LPD/LPI), communication have been extensively studied for
over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert
bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant
$L>0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The
SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of
mathematically-guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using
standard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert
communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is
underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert
communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report
a demonstration of provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication
using software-defined radios (SDRs). This validates theoretical predictions,
opens practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, and
raises further research questions.

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of harsh communication environments, limited energy, and restricted signal transmission in UWSNs by optimizing communication links and transmission parameters.

Method: The method involves formulating the ERCMOP as a Dec-POMDP and using a deep MARL-based TARM strategy, which includes a traffic load-aware mechanism and a solution space optimization algorithm.

Result: Simulation results show that TARM adapts well to various scenarios, supporting efficient and reliable communication in resource-limited underwater networks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed TARM strategy effectively addresses the challenges of efficient and reliable communication in UWSNs by optimizing resource management and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology
that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication.
However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication
environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This
paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater
networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the
scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,
transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication
multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware
Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic
load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring
nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and
global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization
algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based
decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of
TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision
probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with
limited resources.

Method: 1. 利用LLM驱动的数字代理桥接MAR服务与网络域；2. 开发用户级QoE建模方法，实现个性化资源管理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在QoE建模准确性和通信资源效率上优于传统LLM-based方法。

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出DUAL-Health框架，通过不确定性感知的多模态融合解决户外健康监测中的噪声问题，实验证明其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统户外健康监测方法依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，训练数据需求高且难以捕捉细微变化；MLLMs虽具潜力，但面临噪声和模态融合的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种不确定性感知的多模态融合框架DUAL-Health，通过量化模态不确定性、定制融合权重和对齐模态分布来解决噪声问题。

Result: 实验表明，DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health框架在动态和嘈杂的户外环境中表现出色，显著提升了健康监测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.
