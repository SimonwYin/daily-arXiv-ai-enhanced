TL;DR: 本文综述了基于AI的植物病虫害检测方法，比较了不同技术的性能，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高作物产量和减少经济损失需要更精确、高效的植物病虫害检测方法。

Method: 将现代计算机技术分为五类：高光谱成像、非可视化技术、可视化方法、改进的深度学习架构和Transformer模型。

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI是一个基于图像增强的分子功能基序序列表示框架，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），通过结合全局和局部结构信息，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起，因此需要更全面的表示方法。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，通过基于Transformer的编码器嵌入序列，并结合全局分子图像信息（如纹理、阴影、颜色等）增强空间表示。

Result: 实验表明，ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合功能基序序列和分子图像信息，显著提升了DDI预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源受限的IoT设备难以处理深度学习目标检测模型的计算负载，且现有综述常忽略TinyML环境中的优化挑战，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 论文采用综述方法，详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并探讨了理论方法和实际实现。

Conclusion: 该论文总结了在TinyML环境中部署目标检测模型的关键优化技术，并提供了现有实现的性能比较，同时通过公开仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，通过NTKD技术提升混合光学神经网络的性能，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有潜力，但其应用受到训练精度差距和模拟与实际系统差异的限制。

Method: 论文提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，包括光学系统设计前的模型精度估计、训练阶段的NTKD技术以及制造后的数字后端微调。

Result: 实验表明，该管道在多个数据集（如MNIST、CIFAR、Carvana Masking）和硬件配置上均能显著提升ONN性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，通过Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD)技术，显著提升了混合光学神经网络（ONNs）的性能，并在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，通过模块化设计和3E原则提升长序列视频生成的质量和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: MAViS通过多个阶段的智能体协作（如脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模等），并在每个阶段应用3E原则（探索、检查、增强）来优化中间输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和视频表现力方面达到了最先进的性能，并能与多样化的生成模型和工具兼容。

Conclusion: MAViS是一个端到端的多智能体协作框架，通过模块化设计和3E原则，显著提升了长序列视频生成的辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装虚拟试穿框架，通过联合建模上下服装与个人身份，显著提升了试穿的逼真度和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁重的预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致逼真度和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出MuGa-VTON框架，包含三个关键模块：GRM（服装语义捕捉）、PRM（身份和姿态编码）和A-DiT（通过扩散变压器融合服装、个人及文本提示特征）。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON适用于现实世界的虚拟试穿应用，支持基于提示的细粒度服装定制。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CObL是一种基于扩散的架构，用于从图像中推断出遮挡有序的对象层堆栈，能够零样本泛化到真实世界的多对象场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡顺序。

Method: 使用扩散模型（CObL）生成并行的对象层堆栈，利用Stable Diffusion作为先验，并通过推理时指导确保层堆栈复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成数据上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界的多对象场景，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督对象中心表示学习中表现出色，能够处理多对象遮挡场景，且不限于训练环境。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在顺序视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深度叙事推理之间的关键差距，尤其在漫画叙事理解中表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前大型多模态模型在单个面板解释上表现优异，但在时间因果性和跨面板连贯性等核心故事理解要求上系统性失败。

Method: 引入结合细粒度多模态注释、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估的新评估框架，包括严格注释协议、多推理范式评估和跨模态相似性分析。

Result: 在《Re:Zero》漫画的308个注释面板上应用该框架，发现当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本研究为评估叙事智能奠定了基础，并提供了关于多模态模型在离散视觉叙事中深度顺序理解能力的实用见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需访问模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）容易被检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入性运行时访问，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过生成诱导目标激活模式的通用转向图像，仅通过视觉输入实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在三种对齐任务中表现优异，单个150KB转向图像性能接近转向向量，且在负面转向中表现更优。

Conclusion: VISOR重新定义了多模态模型控制方式，揭示了视觉转向攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用平行文本行图像和距离目标函数，提升近代日本文献OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献转录耗时且数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练。

Method: 通过平行文本行图像对，引入基于距离的目标函数（欧氏距离和MMD）来减少特征差异。

Result: 字符错误率分别降低2.23%（欧氏距离）和3.94%（MMD）。

Conclusion: 方法提升了自注意力表示质量，改善了历史文献OCR性能。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn通过学习自适应温度显著降低ViT的校准误差，保持准确性且参数增加极少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而现有的全局温度缩放方法需要额外的验证集且不够灵活。

Method: 提出Calibration Attention (CalAttn)模块，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度，直接从ViT的CLS令牌中学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低了高达4倍，同时仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn是一种简单、高效且与架构无关的模块，能够显著降低校准误差，同时保持模型准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，通过多样化的教师模型和标签传播技术，解决了医学图像分割中的半监督学习和领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，有限的标注和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务设计，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架在解决半监督医学图像分割和领域适应问题上表现出色，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性差距，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在盲脸恢复中存在适应性差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像以及合成与真实图像之间的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换恢复模式（整合BFR特征和面部嵌入）和退化模式（合成真实退化图像）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过双模式设计有效解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Motivation: 现有算法在左心室指标测量中因训练数据少而难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且现有视觉基础模型（如SAM）无法识别关键解剖点。

Method: 提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的分割能力和关键点定位任务，引入FCBA和SGPA模块优化特征表示和预测准确性。

Conclusion: AutoSAME框架通过结合SAM的视觉理解能力和分割与关键点定位任务，成功实现了符合临床指南的左心室指标测量，并通过FCBA和SGPA模块进一步优化了性能。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助标注或假设源域和目标域组相同，这在现实中不自然且不实用。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型通过梯度注意力引导，分离超类相关和不相关特征，并鼓励使用所有超类相关特征进行预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线，定量和定性结果均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用语义结构，无需额外标注即可有效提升对复杂虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成具有高度可控性和真实感的视频，实现了“任何人、任何动作、任何地点”的视频生成。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Conclusion: DocThinker通过基于规则的强化学习框架显著提升了多模态大语言模型在文档理解中的可解释性和适应性，同时避免了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: DETR-based方法在HOI检测中因随机初始化查询缺乏语义信息导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，包含ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD解码器，分别提取动作相关特征和优化对象查询初始化。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义引导的查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测性能，并具备强泛化能力。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

Method: 提出了一种名为 TransMiter 的轻量级适配器，通过无监督方式捕捉预训练和微调模型之间的知识差距，并支持跨模型的知识迁移。

Conclusion: TransMiter 是一种轻量级适配器，能够在不进行反向传播的情况下有效提升视觉语言模型的性能，同时保持其泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，能够显著提升视觉-语言知识蒸馏的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN在多模态医学图像融合任务中表现出色，且可扩展到其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的实时越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的ViT和轻量级解码器，显著提高了精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测因边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有多模态方法因LiDAR计算耗时无法满足实时需求。

Method: 使用预训练的ViT提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量级解码器，避免依赖LiDAR数据。

Result: 在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法实现了高效实时的越野自由空间检测，优于现有多模态方法。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有公开数据集仅限于静态图像数据，无法考虑时间带动态，因此创建了首个开放视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding，以系统研究带视频质量评估问题。

Method: 通过深度学习神经网络嵌入的自然图像统计特性，开发了一种名为CBAND的无参考视频质量评估工具。

Conclusion: CBAND是一种高效且有效的无参考视频质量评估工具，显著优于现有最先进模型，并可作为可微分损失函数优化视频去带模型。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Conclusion: 提出的修复模块通过生成和过滤合成数据，有效解决了视觉模型中罕见子群体的错误问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度分割网络在交叉熵损失下对所有像素平等加权，忽略了晶状体结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。

Method: 提出ACW损失，通过置信度阈值将晶状体结构子区域分组，并设计自适应置信度阈值优化算法；同时提出BECE指标量化边界区域的校准误差。

Result: 在AS-OCT数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，U-Net下IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效利用了专家标注的置信度先验，提升了分割性能和校准能力，适用于多结构数据集。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模拟社交网络视频压缩的框架，以提升深度伪造检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于社交网络平台（如YouTube和Facebook）应用的专有压缩技术，深度伪造检测器在受控条件下训练后难以泛化到真实场景。论文旨在解决这一问题，通过模拟平台特定的压缩和调整大小过程，以提升检测器在真实场景中的性能。

Method: 论文提出了一种框架，通过从少量上传的视频中估计压缩和调整大小参数，模拟社交网络的视频共享管道。这些参数使得本地模拟器能够在大型数据集上重现平台特定的伪影，而无需直接访问API。

Result: 实验结果表明，模拟数据能够紧密匹配真实上传视频的退化模式。此外，在模拟视频上微调的检测器性能与在实际共享媒体上训练的检测器相当。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种模拟社交网络视频共享管道的框架，通过估计压缩和调整大小参数，能够在没有直接API访问的情况下大规模重现平台特定的伪影。实验表明，该方法能够有效缩小实验室训练与实际部署之间的差距，为深度伪造检测器在压缩视频内容领域的应用提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力，包含大量场景和查询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D检索系统通常适用于简单场景，而现实场景更复杂，需要从杂乱场景中根据模糊描述识别对象。

Method: ROOMELSA通过关注全景房间图像中的特定区域，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 实验表明，粗粒度对象检索已基本解决，但只有一种顶级模型在几乎所有测试案例中始终排名第一。轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在材料、部件结构和上下文线索的细微变化上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA通过弥合场景级定位和细粒度3D检索之间的差距，为推进鲁棒的、现实世界的3D识别系统建立了新基准。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Motivation: 动物姿态估计在生态监测、行为分析和智能畜牧管理中具有重要意义，但由于物种形态多样性高、身体结构复杂和标注数据有限，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: DiffPose-Animal采用扩散模型框架，将姿态估计重新定义为去噪过程，并利用大型语言模型提取全局解剖学先验和局部关键点语义，通过交叉注意力模块融合图像特征。

Result: 在公开的动物姿态数据集上，DiffPose-Animal表现出色，尤其在物种多样性、复杂背景和关键点不完整的情况下具有优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过扩散模型和大型语言模型的结合，显著提升了动物姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在物种多样性、复杂背景和关键点不完整的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，导致视频质量下降，且缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，RPO-AdaSharp 在定性和定量上均表现出色。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp 是一种端到端的区域自适应视频锐化模型，通过利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，有效提升了视频质量并节省了比特率。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在 ZJU-MoCap 和 MonoCap 数据集上的实验表明，MonoPartNeRF 在复杂姿势和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF 在复杂姿势和遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法，实现了更好的关节对齐、纹理保真度和结构连续性。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式能有效提升轻量级语义分割性能，且无需额外架构改动，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Conclusion: TARA 通过引入令牌掩码和训练目标，有效解决了多概念生成中的干扰和空间对齐问题，实现了高效的多概念推理并保留了每个概念的视觉身份。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

Method: 通过定义各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量，利用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制，构建了一个两阶段系统：先分类主要伪影类型，再通过回归模型量化质量退化。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR分数与人类感知的Spearman相关性达到-0.93（高斯模糊）和-0.95（白噪声），分类准确率超过97%，整体系统预测人类评分的R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS点。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分析方向性图像曲率，提出了一种新颖的无参考图像质量评估方法，能够高效分类和量化图像退化，表现出高预测准确性。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用频率注意力特征金字塔预测网络（FFPN）预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练FFPN。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合评估表明，该框架能够实现视觉上的显著提升并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于学习的自适应高频预处理框架在视频编码中显著提升了主观质量并节省了比特率，通过FFPN网络实现了比特率与质量的最佳权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的管道和模型能够实现稳健的自动分割、MR序列分类和标准化报告生成，符合RANO 2.0指南，提升了术后评估和临床决策的效率。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 通过引入流形学习和伪全局信息引导，新方法能够更准确地表征数据分布和类间依赖关系，显著提升了LiDAR地点识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

TL;DR: A robotic ultrasound system with real-time shape completion improves spinal visualization by addressing shadowing artifacts and registration limitations, validated on phantoms and volunteers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging in spinal procedures is hindered by shadowing artifacts, and traditional CT-to-US registration methods are limited by complex requirements and recent CT imaging needs.

Method: The system autonomously acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based shape completion network.

Result: The framework provides interactive, real-time visualization with autonomous scan repetition and navigation capabilities, validated through quantitative experiments and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated system combining robotic ultrasound with real-time shape completion enhances spinal visualization, offering better consistency, reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Motivation: 面部变形攻击（MAD）是面部识别安全中的一个关键挑战，攻击者通过将多个个体的身份信息插值到一张面部图像中，欺骗识别系统。现有的多模态基础模型（如CLIP）在生物识别任务中通常需要微调，而忽视了其直接部署的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过高效的提示工程，CLIP模型可以在不进行额外训练或微调的情况下，有效检测面部变形攻击，为生物识别安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Conclusion: 布局条件能有效提升故事生成任务的精细控制和一致性，Lay2Story框架为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Result: 实验表明，TCSSM在多个域上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM和BrightVQA数据集为CDVQA的域泛化研究提供了有效工具，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

TL;DR: 利用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐，提出ColorGPT方法，在颜色建议准确性和多样性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色推荐方法因设计复杂和数据有限而效果不佳，探索LLMs的常识推理能力是否能提升颜色推荐任务。

Method: 开发ColorGPT管道，测试多种颜色表示方法并应用提示工程技术，支持颜色调色板补全和完整生成。

Result: 在颜色调色板补全任务中表现优于现有方法，在完整调色板生成任务中提升了颜色多样性和相似性。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs可作为颜色推荐任务的优秀设计工具，ColorGPT方法在多个任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs的压缩策略忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息丢失，因此需要一种更高效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出KFFocus方法，结合经典视频压缩原理，动态识别关键帧并分配不同的压缩比例，同时引入时空建模模块以捕捉时空动态。

Result: 在广泛认可的视频理解基准测试中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，实现了计算效率和高准确性的双重提升。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过改进视频压缩策略和引入时空建模模块，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性，尤其在长视频场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Method: 提出MSQ方法，通过多尺度编码和量化将运动序列压缩为离散令牌。

Result: MSQ在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，支持无缝组合运动令牌。

Conclusion: MSQ有效解决了运动表示的多尺度建模和组合灵活性问题，提升了生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniConvNet提供了一种高效扩展ERF的通用范式，适用于不同规模的卷积网络，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex方法在分解图像为光照和反射组件时存在互组件残差（ICR），影响分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 提出IRetinex模型，在分解阶段使用互组件残差减少模块，在增强阶段利用组件间特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex模型显著提升了低光图像增强的性能，证明了ICR的重要性及其处理方法的有效性。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上验证，UC-Seg优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg有效减少认知偏差并提升分割性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Motivation: 由于深度伪造内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，需要有效利用大规模未标注数据的方法。

Method: 提出DPGNet，包含文本引导跨域对齐和课程驱动伪标签生成模块，结合跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用未标注数据有效解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战，展示了其在现实场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过视觉提示整合空间和时间信息的新方法，显著提高了任务解决的成功率，且在数据稀缺的情况下仍能有效工作。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Conclusion: 该方法通过个性化步骤和注意力损失项显著提升了文本到图像个性化任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

TL;DR: An active learning framework for VAD improves adaptability in dynamic environments by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback and adaptive thresholds, achieving an EBI of 68.91.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of VAD in real-world settings, where traditional metrics fail due to dynamic human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts.

Method: The method involves an active learning framework tailored for VAD, incorporating a human-in-the-loop mechanism to refine pseudo-labeling results and define adaptive thresholds for different environments.

Result: Experimental results show the method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed active learning framework significantly enhances the applicability of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) in dynamic environments by adapting to changing conditions and improving model performance.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过结合语义和几何损失设计，显著提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知精度，验证了其有效性和先进性。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Motivation: 移动设备上部署大型生成AI模型的需求增长，但现有视频VAE的计算瓶颈（如参数过大和内核不匹配）导致内存不足或推理速度极慢。

Method: 通过分析冗余并引入3D深度可分离卷积减少参数；提出解耦的3D像素洗牌方案优化上采样；仅蒸馏解码器以快速适配移动设备。

Result: Turbo-VAED在720p分辨率下加速原始VAE达84.5倍，参数减少至17.5%，重建质量保留96.9%，在iPhone 16 Pro上FPS提升2.9倍。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上的实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有高效、低成本和高质量的特点。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个公开的大规模多视角单光源（OLAT）全身人体数据集HumanOLAT，用于促进人体重光照和新视角渲染的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏公开的高质量全身人体数据集，限制了人体重光照和新视角渲染领域的研究进展。

Method: 构建了HumanOLAT数据集，包含多视角OLAT捕捉的HDR RGB帧，涵盖多种光照条件（如白光、环境光、颜色渐变和细粒度OLAT光照）。

Result: 评估了现有重光照和新视角合成方法，展示了数据集的实用性和当前技术在处理复杂人体外观与光照交互时的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT数据集将为未来研究提供重要支持，推动人体重光照和渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM是一个新的数学推理基准，用于评估大型语言模型在高级数学问题上的表现，具有抗训练集污染的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学推理基准已接近饱和，且受到训练集污染的威胁，需要动态且抗污染的评估框架。

Method: 通过从Putnam数学竞赛中选取522个问题，并生成100个功能变体，构建了一个动态且抗污染的测试集。

Result: 最强模型在原始集上准确率为41.9%，但在变体集上下降了19.6%，表明模型存在记忆问题。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一个严格的评估框架，用于测试LLMs的高级数学推理能力。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Motivation: 金融论据质量评估在文献中研究不足，影响投资决策和公众信任。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的一致性和对抗性别偏见的攻击。

Result: LLM标注比人类标注一致性更高，但仍存在性别偏见。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究采用更可靠、经济高效且无偏见的标注方法。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的委员会辩论方法，通过多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟结构化学术讨论，用于检测推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。委员会辩论方法在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学网络话语检测任务（Task 4a）中的挑战，特别是识别推文中的科学内容。

Method: 提出三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 委员会辩论在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣和情感支持工具的潜力。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试评估小型和大型语言模型的认知和情感共情能力。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情方面显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在模拟认知共情方面表现出色，适合提供客观一致的情感支持，但情感共情能力仍需提升。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻网站常将新闻按主题组织成故事，但现有方法（如聚类或主题建模）无法基于特定事件、地点和人物进行分组。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream和TextClust），提取特定事件和命名实体以实现故事识别。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体一个月的新闻数据集上验证，人工评估表明该方法能产生合理结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现实时故事识别，适用于新闻监控系统。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

TL;DR: TT-XAI是一个轻量级框架，通过关键词蒸馏和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床语言模型在处理长且非结构化的电子健康记录时，预测和解释的可信度不足。

Method: 使用关键词蒸馏将原始出院记录转化为简洁表示，并通过关键词引导的提示生成临床解释。

Result: 关键词增强方法在机器和人类可解释性上均表现更优。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了巨大影响，需要自动化的检测方法。

Method: 使用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合LLMs和轻量级分类器构建SCBM模型。

Result: 在五个数据集上平均macro-F1得分为0.69，优于现有方法，且融合Transformer嵌入后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词概念表示是紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方法，可推广到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Result: 提出了并行文本生成方法的分类框架，并总结了其性能权衡及与其他加速策略的结合潜力。

Conclusion: 并行文本生成是提高推理效率的重要方向，未来研究应关注技术改进和挑战解决。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性切除评估其因果作用，比较不同单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器衍生的单元对心理理论任务影响更显著。

Conclusion: 研究质疑对比定位器的因果相关性，建议使用更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务特定单元捕捉方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案，并开源框架以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管存在多种幻觉检测方法，但其评估通常依赖于ROUGE指标，该指标基于词汇重叠，与人类判断不一致，导致性能估计误导。

Method: 通过全面的人类研究，论文比较了基于ROUGE的评估与人类对齐指标（如LLM-as-Judge）的效果，并分析了简单启发式方法（如基于响应长度）与复杂检测技术的表现。

Result: 研究发现，ROUGE指标虽然召回率高，但精确度极低，导致性能估计不准确。此外，简单启发式方法的表现与复杂技术相当，揭示了当前评估实践的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 论文强调，采用语义感知和稳健的评估框架对于准确衡量幻觉检测方法的真实性能至关重要，从而确保大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在宗教应用中需要任务特定的评估和谨慎部署LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，提升教学指导和推理支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性响应和易受情感操控。

Method: 通过CoT数据增强和针对性对话设计，优化开源LLMs。

Result: 优化后的模型在教学指导、推理支持和答案保密性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: CoDAE框架有效提升了LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 使用PRID生成高质量推理数据集，结合MoIA策略（SFT和RPO）优化模型。

Result: Mol-R1在分子推理生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1通过创新策略显著提升了分子生成任务的推理性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

TL;DR: 研究发现，形态对齐对语言模型性能有适度正面影响，但分词算法（如BPE与Unigram）对下游任务表现影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨形态对齐的分词方法是否对复杂形态语言的模型性能有提升作用。

Method: 选择泰卢固语、印地语和英语，从分词训练到下游任务评估进行全面实验，分析形态对齐和分词质量的影响。

Result: 形态对齐与句法任务表现呈正相关，但分词算法（如Unigram）对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有适度提升，但分词算法的选择更为关键，尤其是Unigram分词器表现最佳。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距较大时难以对齐人类偏好，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero方法，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中胜率提升2.0点，MT-Bench中在STEM和人文任务表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单修改偏好目标可显著提升小型LLM的对齐效率，为资源受限部署提供实用方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型内部隐藏状态的变化，发现类似能量的守恒现象，并提出了一种控制方法（Jacobian steering）来优化模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型内部隐藏状态的变化，以提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析了20个开源Transformer模型，提出了一种结合隐藏状态变化率和模型下一标记确定性的“能量”概念，并开发了Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 发现随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地守恒“能量”，训练使模型进入更快、更果断的状态。Jacobian steering在测试模型中保持了接近恒定的能量，并生成了语义质量更高的输出。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角研究Transformer模型，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于使模型更可预测和符合人类意图。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化的用户需求。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元基准测试中表现优于基线方法，并具有可解释性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元对齐提供了新见解，推动了伦理AI的发展，使大语言模型的使用更公平和具有代表性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 开发一种高效的令牌压缩方法，以节省计算资源，同时保持高质量压缩表示。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪训练生成压缩表示，并对编码器进行小修改以优化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下，DeCAL性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中节省显著资源，未来可进一步扩展其应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏大规模、高质量的数据集，阻碍了相关研究的进展。

Method: 使用3,699篇自传体叙事构建数据集，开发了DepressLLM模型和SToPS模块。

Result: AUC达到0.789，高置信度样本AUC提升至0.904，并在其他数据集上验证了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DepressLLM展示了可解释AI在抑郁症早期诊断中的潜力，为精神病学AI应用提供了方向。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: RAG系统（如Qwen3、DeepSeek和Kimi）在理解和生成粤语口语表达时面临标注数据有限和语言变异性问题，因此需要探索参数高效微调方法以优化其性能。

Method: 本文通过系统分析近期研究，评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成、PEFT方法的检索和生成准确性基准、有限数据下的领域适应策略，以及数据稀缺条件下提高语义保真度的微调技术。

Result: 研究发现，动态和集成LoRA适配显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成的准确性。然而，在低资源语言中完全保留语言细微差异仍具挑战性，且实时用户反馈和领域特定数据的集成仍需改进。

Conclusion: 本文综述了参数高效微调（PEFT）在优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的应用，特别是低秩适应（LoRA）方法。尽管动态和集成LoRA适配显著减少了可训练参数且未牺牲检索和生成质量，但在低资源语言（如粤语）中完全保留语言细微差异仍存在挑战。未来研究应关注方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展的微调流程。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: InternBootcamp为RL优化、合成数据生成和模型评估提供了基础设施，任务扩展是实现通用推理能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

TL;DR: LLMs在机器翻译中表现良好，但在低资源语言翻译中表现不佳。TopXGen通过生成高质量、主题多样的数据来提升翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在低资源语言翻译中表现不佳，现有方法受限于平行数据集的大小、质量和多样性。

Method: 提出TopXGen方法，利用LLMs生成高质量、主题多样的目标端文本，并通过回译生成平行文本。

Result: TopXGen在微调和上下文学习中显著提升了LLM的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法，显著提升了翻译性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Result: 通用多语言模型表现优于微调模型，截断架构有助于平衡准确性与速度，但存在高WER的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 近期ASR模型在现实数据中表现良好，截断架构是平衡性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能引导LLMs模仿浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精确且一致地体现目标特质。

Method: 基于心理学理论，自动生成并优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过信息论目标最大化行为与目标特质之间的联系。

Result: IROTE生成的自我反思能在多样任务中稳定诱导LLMs模仿目标特质，表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE通过自我反思优化，解决了LLMs特质激发中的浅层和不稳定问题，实现了稳定且可转移的特质体现。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 标准 LoRA 在多源异构 MLLG 数据集中表现不佳，无法满足语义保真和多样化通俗风格生成的需求。

Method: Magical 采用共享矩阵 $A$ 进行抽象摘要，并通过多个隔离矩阵 $B$ 实现多样化通俗风格生成。此外，还引入了语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Magical 在性能上优于基于提示的方法、标准 LoRA 及其变体，同时减少了 31.66% 的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical 是一种针对异构数据场景下的医学通俗语言生成（MLLG）任务设计的非对称 LoRA 架构，通过共享矩阵 $A$ 和多隔离矩阵 $B$ 的结合，显著提升了语义保真度和多样化生成能力。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Motivation: 科学文献问答对科学发现至关重要，但目前对 RAG-LLMs 中 rerankers 的潜力和局限性尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了三种类型的 Q-C-A 对（NC、SSLI、CC），用于评估 rerankers 在噪声恢复、相关性消歧和事实一致性方面的表现。

Result: 通过对 13 种广泛使用的 rerankers 和五类 LLMs 的系统评估，揭示了它们的相对优势和局限性。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench 是首个专门用于评估 RAG-LLMs 中 rerankers 的基准，为未来研究提供了有价值的观察和指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识不完整的问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）来解决这些问题。然而，使用私有KGs在RAG系统中存在隐私风险，尤其是当使用第三方LLM API时。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包括关系中心抽象策略（将匿名实体抽象为高层概念）和结构导向抽象策略（将自然语言问题转化为结构化抽象概念路径）。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG框架有效解决了隐私保护的RAG场景中的关键挑战，同时保持了高性能和隐私安全性。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

Motivation: 当前缺乏专门为工具使用设计的高效强化学习框架，主要由于构建稳定训练环境和设计可验证奖励机制的挑战。

Method: 提出自动化环境构建管道（包括场景分解、文档生成、函数集成、复杂度缩放和本地化部署）和可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模LLM的工具使用性能，且不损害其通用能力。

Conclusion: 改进的上下文理解和推理能力（源于模型底层MLP参数的更新）是性能提升的关键。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因训练数据固定而导致的知识过时和预测时间泄漏问题。

Method: 预训练一组 GPT 风格的专家模型，每个模型在 2013-2024 语料库的两年片段上训练，并通过 TiMoE（时间感知的混合专家）结合它们。推理时，TiMoE 屏蔽训练窗口在查询时间之后的专家，并在共享空间中合并剩余的对数概率。

Result: 实验表明，TiMoE 在八个标准 NLP 任务和 TSQA 基准上表现优异，匹配或超过最佳单时段专家模型，并将未来知识错误减少高达 15%。

Conclusion: 通过模块化、时间分段的预训练与因果路由结合，TiMoE 提供了一种简单有效的方法，使大语言模型在保持时间准确性的同时，不牺牲整体性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法全面评估LLMs在数学推理中的鲁棒性，因此需要一种新的方法来测试其对非数学扰动的敏感性。

Method: 通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的问题构建PutnamGAP数据集，并评估多种LLMs在这些变体上的表现。

Result: 18个商业和开源模型在变体问题上表现显著下降，例如O3模型在核心步骤变体上下降了10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性问题，为改进其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告的质量评估（QA）依赖资深医生的手动评分，成本高且可能因主观因素导致不准确。

Method: Sqator通过分析修订文本片段（span）的语义差异，计算其重要性得分，并合并所有修订片段得分以输出最终QA评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射学报告上的实验表明，Sqator能生成具有竞争力的QA评分，且修订片段的重要性得分与资深医生的判断一致。

Conclusion: Sqator是一种有效的自动QA评分工具，能够减少人工成本并提供与人工评分一致的结果。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Motivation: 需要理解LLMs在多元文化背景下的文化理解能力，尤其是对较少记录文化的过度泛化问题。

Method: 提出CultureScope，利用修补方法提取文化知识，并引入文化扁平化分数衡量内在文化偏见。

Result: 实验显示LLMs编码了西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来减轻文化偏见和增强LLMs文化理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

TL;DR: ASPD提出了一种自适应串并行解码方法，通过识别并行化结构显著提升LLM推理速度，平均加速1.85倍，且生成质量几乎无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码的串行特性导致LLM推理延迟高，而部分输出段实际可并行解码。

Method: 提出ASPD框架：1) 自动提取并行结构；2) 混合解码引擎实现串/并行模式无缝切换。

Result: 在通用任务、数学推理等场景中，最高加速3.19倍（平均1.85倍），生成质量差异<1%。

Conclusion: ASPD为低延迟LLM推理设定了新基准，适用于客服机器人等高时效场景。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

*Mahmoud Salhab,Shameed Sait,Mohammad Abusheikh,Hasan Abusheikh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline combining weak supervision and fine-tuning achieves top results in Arabic ASR, addressing data scarcity and dialect diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic is challenging due to limited labeled data and linguistic complexity from diverse dialects.

Method: A scalable training pipeline is proposed, involving pretraining on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech (covering Modern Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic variants) followed by continual supervised fine-tuning using a mix of filtered weakly labeled data and a small high-quality annotated dataset.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning effectively addresses the challenges of data scarcity and linguistic complexity in low-resource languages like Arabic, achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-dialectal Arabic ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: 评估语言模型在多语言环境下的多步推理能力，尤其是低资源语言（如孟加拉语）的表现。

Method: 通过手动翻译英语Reveal数据集创建孟加拉语多步推理数据集，并对英语和孟加拉语多语言小语言模型进行受控评估。

Result: 在可比设置下，推理上下文对更具挑战性的非二元问题有益，但模型难以有效利用孟加拉语推理步骤。

Conclusion: 研究发现，推理步骤对模型的预测有显著影响，但不同模型和语言之间存在差异。模型在处理孟加拉语推理步骤时表现不佳。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定长度训练预算，未能利用学习过程中从探索到压缩的自然进展。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和奖励函数，逐步减少token预算。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于固定预算基线，准确性和token效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 渐进约束是一种有效的归纳偏置，可训练高效推理模型。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT 通过联合生成和忠实归因答案，解决了 LLM 的幻觉问题，显著提升了可信度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐标记生成与归因生成方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT 通过两个步骤实现：1) 用特定标记标识文档，并利用这些标记的 logits 估计文档对答案的贡献；2) 将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在 Trust-Align 基准测试中，LoDIT 在多个指标上显著优于现有最先进模型，同时表现出低延迟和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LoDIT 是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，通过联合生成和忠实归因答案，显著提升了大型语言模型在 RAG 中的可信度。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新型的KV缓存更新技术，通过修正累积的注意力错误，显著提升了长序列解码的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文任务中，KV缓存的内存占用和延迟问题成为瓶颈，现有方法未能解决解码过程中的累积注意力错误。

Method: 提出RetroAttention技术，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目修正过去的注意力输出，保持轻量级输出缓存。

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention比现有方法提升有效KV暴露1.6倍，准确率提升21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention通过动态修正注意力输出，显著提升了长序列任务的性能和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 直接应用LLMs于患者治疗场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者来训练治疗师。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗师培训场景中显示出显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in

users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user

acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临评估标准不明确和奖励信号不稳定的双重挑战。

Method: 提出了Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO)方法，从样本评分转向组间比较评分，并设计了CharacterArena评估框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CPO有效减少了奖励模糊性，显著提升了对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena为强化学习在主观任务中的应用提供了更稳健和公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

Motivation: 大语言模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，现有方法仅使用最终编码层，限制了性能。

Method: 提出融合所有中间层的架构，采用全局Softmax和Transformer Softmax策略，映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在XNLI等任务上显著超越基线，低资源语言如Sinhala准确率从71.66%提升至75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言LLM提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Method: 将记录链接（RL）任务视为跨文档共指消解（CDCR）任务，并结合自然语言推理（NLI）和语义文本相似性（STS），将其转化为因果推理（CI）问题。

Conclusion: 通过将最先进的CDCR模型进行领域适配并增强推理能力，可以有效地应用于流程工业，显著提升班次日志的数据质量和连接性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and

TL;DR: 提出AutoCodeGen方法自动生成高质量多语言代码生成数据集，构建AutoCodeBench基准测试，评估显示LLMs在多语言任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试存在依赖人工标注、语言分布不均和难度有限等问题，亟需一种自动化方法生成高质量多语言数据集。

Method: 提出AutoCodeGen方法，通过LLMs生成测试输入，并通过多语言沙箱获取测试输出，结合逆序问题生成和多步过滤确保数据质量。

Result: 构建了AutoCodeBench基准测试，包含3,920个问题，均匀分布在20种编程语言中，评估显示即使是先进LLMs也面临挑战。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列旨在成为评估LLMs在多语言代码生成任务中的宝贵资源，并激励社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的多语言代码生成场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

TL;DR: SinLlama是一个针对低资源语言Sinhala优化的开源LLM，通过增强分词器和持续预训练，显著提升了在Sinhala文本分类任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言如Sinhala在开源大语言模型中常被忽视，需要专门优化以提升其支持。

Method: 扩展Llama-3-8B的分词器，加入Sinhala专用词汇，并在10百万Sinhala语料上进行持续预训练。

Result: SinLlama在指令微调后的文本分类任务中显著优于Llama-3-8B及其指令变体。

Conclusion: SinLlama是首个明确支持Sinhala的开源解码器LLM，为低资源语言提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: OdysseyBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在长期工作流程中表现的基准测试，包含真实用例和新合成的复杂任务，通过HomerAgents框架自动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注独立任务，无法反映现实场景中的长期上下文依赖和多交互协调需求。

Method: 提出OdysseyBench，包含两个任务集（OdysseyBench+和OdysseyBench-Neo），并通过HomerAgents框架自动化生成长期工作流程基准测试。

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供比原子任务基准更准确的评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展和评估的重要资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在逻辑丰富指令下的表现，填补研究空白。

Method: LogicIFGen从代码函数生成可验证指令，LogicIFEval作为包含426条指令的基准。

Result: 当前LLMs仅能正确遵循不到60%的指令，表现不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑丰富指令下的能力仍有显著缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在解码过程中存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了丰富的中间预测，而实验发现正确结果往往出现在中间步骤，但被后续去噪步骤覆盖。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票：一种无需训练的测试时解码策略，聚合去噪步骤的预测；2) 时间一致性强化：通过时间语义熵（TSE）作为奖励信号，鼓励稳定生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，仅使用负TSE奖励就在Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%，结合准确率奖励后，在GSM8K、MATH500、SVAMP和Countdown上分别提升2.0%、4.3%、6.6%和25.3%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用它们。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中去噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升肺炎分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线成像因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统去噪方法会破坏细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，且计算高效。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐蔽通信的理论研究已有十多年，但硬件实现和实验验证仍不足，尤其是在射频领域。

Method: 利用软件定义无线电（SDR）进行实验，验证隐蔽通信的平方根定律（SRL）。

Result: 成功实现了可证明安全的隐蔽射频通信，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为隐蔽通信系统的实际应用开辟了道路，并提出了进一步的研究问题。

Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of
detection/intercept (LPD/LPI), communication have been extensively studied for
over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert
bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant
$L>0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The
SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of
mathematically-guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using
standard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert
communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is
underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert
communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report
a demonstration of provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication
using software-defined radios (SDRs). This validates theoretical predictions,
opens practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, and
raises further research questions.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的适应性WBAN框架，旨在解决当前WBAN在适应性、能源效率和量子抗性安全方面的不足，为下一代移动健康应用提供超可靠、安全和自优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology
that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication.
However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication
environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This
paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater
networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the
scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,
transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication
multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware
Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic
load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring
nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and
global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization
algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based
decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of
TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision
probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with
limited resources.

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 传统户外健康监测依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，需要大量数据训练且难以捕捉细微健康变化；而基于MLLM的方法虽需少量数据，但面临噪声和模态融合的挑战。

Method: 提出DUAL-Health框架：1）量化输入和波动噪声引起的模态不确定性；2）基于不确定性定制融合权重；3）在共同语义空间中对齐模态分布。

Result: 实验表明，DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health通过不确定性感知的模态融合和分布对齐，有效解决了户外健康监测中的噪声和模态融合问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

Motivation: 分散式联邦学习（DFL）在边缘计算系统中面临通信瓶颈、资源异构性和数据异构性等挑战，影响了模型性能和能源效率。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段算法，动态构建最优通信拓扑，并设计了一个重要性感知的模型聚合机制。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed 是一个针对边缘计算系统的异构感知和成本高效的分散式联邦学习框架，通过动态构建通信拓扑和重要性感知的模型聚合机制，解决了模型性能和能源效率的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变而具有挑战性，尤其是在多站点场景中需要同时建模时空动态。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应下采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势和周期成分，并通过交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空和生态信息。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet在多站点时间序列预测中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet通过逐步多模态融合有效捕捉长期趋势和短期波动，提升了时空分布时间序列预测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法在训练和测试数据分布不同（域偏移）时性能下降，而半监督域自适应（SSDA）是解决此问题的主要方法。

Method: MoSSDA采用域不变编码器学习源域和目标域的特征，并通过混合增强正对比模块和在线动量编码器优化特征表示。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和各模块的有效性，显著提升了半监督域自适应在多变量时间序列分类中的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Conclusion: MGSTC通过多粒度时空特征互补和在线学习策略，有效解决了蜂窝流量预测中的突发性和概念漂移问题，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

*Elon Litman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a first-principles justification for SDPA, showing it solves an EOT problem and links backpropagation to policy gradients, unifying inference and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a rigorous, optimization-based justification for the SDPA mechanism, which is often motivated by heuristics in modern deep learning.

Method: The paper uses a first-principles approach to justify SDPA, showing that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem. It also proves that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically identical to an advantage-based policy gradient.

Result: The results demonstrate that the EOT formulation induces a specific information geometry on the space of attention distributions, revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the optimization problem.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

TL;DR: SHEFL 是一种全局集成联邦学习框架，通过动态资源分配和新聚合方案，解决了计算异构性问题，提高了公平性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的系统异构联邦学习方案通常忽视通信效率的典型约束，而基于集成的联邦学习方法未能充分捕捉模型预测的多样性。因此，需要一种能够适应客户端计算能力多样性并提高性能的框架。

Method: SHEFL 根据客户端的可用资源分配不同数量的全局模型，并引入了一种新的聚合方案，考虑不同计算能力客户端之间的偏差。此外，通过动态调整资源比例，减少计算负担并缓解数据偏差。

Result: 实验表明，SHEFL 在计算异构性方面表现优异，显著提高了公平性和整体性能。

Conclusion: SHEFL 是一种适用于具有不同计算能力的客户端的全局集成联邦学习框架，通过动态调整资源分配和引入新的聚合方案，有效解决了计算异构性问题，显著提高了公平性和整体性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Result: 理论框架揭示了注意力头的存储容量、误差传播的架构权衡，以及生物学习规则如何增强Transformer架构。

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能不仅源于架构创新，还因为实现了生物学在数百万年进化中优化的计算原理。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OOPE算法利用离线数据优化在线遗憾，表现优于现有方法，并在不同数据质量下均达到最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线推荐系统和广告等领域中，离线数据广泛可用，如何有效利用这些数据以减少在线遗憾是一个重要问题。

Method: OOPE采用扩展的D-optimal设计，结合Frank-Wolfe近似，优化了探索阶段的效率。

Result: OOPE的在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，并在离线数据质量高时进一步优化为$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$。

Conclusion: OOPE算法通过有效利用离线数据显著降低了在线遗憾，并在离线数据质量不同的情况下均表现出最优性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: 该方法结合物理信息，提高了高光谱成像目标识别的灵活性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to
improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning

ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms
multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF 是一个新颖的框架，能够在存在未测量混杂因子的情况下，通过干预数据学习非线性循环因果图。实验证明其在因果图恢复和混杂因子识别方面优于现有方法，并提供了理论一致性保证。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Result: The statistical approach consistently outperforms machine learning in identification across all scenarios. For quantification, the statistical approach provides accurate estimates, while machine learning results are less satisfactory.

Conclusion: The statistical approach outperforms machine learning in radionuclide identification and quantification, especially with known or well-modeled spectral signatures. Machine learning is a viable alternative under uncertain measurement conditions.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

TL;DR: 通过优化技术和灵活激活函数，BNNs能有效实现复杂函数空间先验，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数空间先验在BNNs中能更直观地嵌入先验信念，但实现这一目标具有挑战性。

Method: 采用优化技术探索可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）以适应高复杂度先验，并匹配目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐藏层的BNNs，配备灵活的可训练激活函数，也能有效实现所需的函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 通过优化技术和灵活的激活函数模型，BNNs能够有效实现复杂的函数空间先验，提升正则化、不确定性量化和风险感知决策能力。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Motivation: GNN在深度层存在过平滑问题，现有方法在深层特征上表现不佳，Mamba虽能保留全局拓扑信息但忽略浅层细节。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）和源感知融合（SAF）模块，动态选择投影方式并融合多级特征。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了全局-局部权衡问题，提升了分子表示学习性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何利用注意力机制中的权重信息来增强Transformer模型的可解释性，提出了两种新的解释方法，分别用于局部和全局解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力权重虽然不直接决定模型输出，但能反映token间的影响模式，可以补充现有的可解释性技术。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 将注意力权重整合到Shapley值分解中，用于局部解释；2) 将注意力权重与概念激活向量结合，用于全局解释。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重能有效融入XAI框架，提升Transformer模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重可以丰富Transformer模型的可解释性，为模型行为提供更全面的解释。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL是一种结合分层联邦学习和分割学习的方法，通过中间层表示学习显著降低了通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架忽视了边缘客户端的计算异构性和资源受限设备的训练负担，同时存在高通信成本和复杂模型聚合的问题。

Method: 提出SHeRL-FL，整合分割学习和分层模型聚合，并在中间层引入表示学习，使客户端和边缘服务器能独立于云端计算训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，SHeRL-FL在图像分类和分割任务中，数据传输量比集中式FL和HierFL减少90%以上，比SplitFed减少50%。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL有效降低了通信开销和协调复杂性，同时提升了分层分割学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动测试方法因计算成本高而难以应用于大型模型评估，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用上下文学习构建低成本代理模型，无需在主动测试循环中更新，且代理模型可小于目标模型。还引入了单次运行误差估计器。

Result: 该方法能更有效地评估LLM性能，所需数据量少于当前标准方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过上下文学习和单次运行误差估计器，可以低成本高效地扩展主动测试方法至大型语言模型评估。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM) 通过模糊评估子句中的字面量，显著减少了所需子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 Tsetlin Machine (TM) 采用“全有或全无”的子句评估策略，导致需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确率。FPTM 旨在通过模糊评估机制解决这一问题。

Method: FPTM 引入模糊评估机制，允许子句中部分字面量失败时，其余字面量仍能按比例贡献投票分数，从而更灵活地匹配模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM 显著减少了子句数量（如 IMDb 数据集减少 50 倍），训练速度提升（最高 316 倍），内存占用降低（50 KB），并在准确性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FPTM 是一种高效、灵活且鲁棒的 TM 变体，适用于资源受限的环境，如微控制器上的在线学习。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: Oblivionis是一个轻量级的联邦学习框架，旨在解决联邦学习中LLM的遗忘问题，提升数据隐私和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习框架缺乏内置机制来处理GDPR等法规的“被遗忘权”要求，且现有方法无法选择性删除特定客户端数据。

Method: 通过将联邦学习和遗忘作为双重优化目标，结合6种FL和5种遗忘算法，构建了Oblivionis框架。

Result: 实验表明，Oblivionis在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了平衡，优于本地训练方法。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案，并为未来LLM发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Result: DiGNNExplainer生成的解释既真实又忠实于模型的决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer填补了异构图解释的空白，提供更真实和可信的解释。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入度量质量相等，而现实数据往往不平衡。部分最优传输（POT）虽解决了这一问题，但现有方法因熵正则化导致传输计划密集，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种二次正则化的POT（QPOT）方法，通过二次正则化诱导稀疏传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集以及颜色迁移和领域适应等实际应用中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Result: 在异构环境中，该方法显著加速本地SGD，达到与同步SGD相当的精度，甚至更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境，为高效利用异构资源提供了基础并行策略。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods struggle to balance exploration and exploitation in black-box optimization tasks, and existing TTT approaches require hand-crafted training data, limiting scalability.

Method: MiGrATe uses GRPO as a search algorithm for online TTT, combining on-policy sampling with greedy sampling and neighborhood sampling (NS) to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: MiGrATe outperforms baselines in word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program induction tasks.

Conclusion: MiGrATe consistently outperforms inference-only and TTT baselines across multiple domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of online TTT for complex search tasks without external supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

TL;DR: A novel OCIL method using a Global Workspace Model and multi-level distillation improves stability and plasticity, outperforming existing approaches under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces challenges in maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Current replay-based methods are less effective under stricter constraints, while ensemble methods struggle with stability.

Method: The approach enhances ensemble learning by using a GWM—a shared, implicit memory that fuses student model parameters within each training batch. It also employs multi-level collaborative distillation to enforce peer-to-peer consistency and align students with the GWM.

Result: Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed method, leveraging a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and multi-level collaborative distillation, effectively balances stability and plasticity in OCIL, achieving significant performance improvements across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成采样方法提高了TSP求解器的分布鲁棒性，尤其在最坏情况下表现显著优于现有神经方法。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解RF模型在多步和一步生成中的优异表现提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型在时间序列预测领域表现出色，尤其是WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现优异，证明了其高效性和轻量级特性。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Result: 框架成功应用于流电池歧管设计，有效捕捉可行设计空间，包括新颖配置，并实现高效探索。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提升质量和可靠性，拓宽了生成机器学习模型在系统设计中的适用性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度脆弱，现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 阶段转移攻击对持续学习模型构成严重安全威胁，需开发更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进，显著提升了物理信息神经网络在复杂科学和工程问题中的预测准确性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，GenCast显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理原理，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测性能。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Result: 在真实数据集上，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态场驱动机制提升了顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，填补了相关研究空白。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限的设备上表现优异，显著提升了边缘智能系统的效率和性能。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to

baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模基准测试比较了多种链接预测算法，发现没有单一算法在所有网络中表现最佳，并提出了一种基于网络特性的元学习算法来优化预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的关系数据（如社交网络或生物网络）通常不完整，现有方法在无节点属性的网络中预测缺失链接时，缺乏对不同算法性能及其依赖网络特性的系统研究。

Method: 使用550个结构多样的真实网络基准，比较了四种堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器（包括两种新提出的方法）和两种图神经网络算法，评估了它们在AUC和Top-k两种标准下的表现。

Result: 结果显示，没有算法在所有网络中表现最佳，大多数算法在社交网络中表现良好，但在经济和生物网络中表现较差。随机森林堆叠方法在AUC上优于或与图神经网络在Top-k上竞争。算法性能高度依赖网络特性（如度分布、三角形密度等）。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于网络特性的元学习算法，能够为单个网络选择最佳算法，显著优于现有方法，并适用于大规模网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

Conclusion: 通过利用高阶几何知识和符号计算卸载，该方法显著提升了几何问题解决的性能，并为未来研究提供了实用设计建议。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式，如不同的模式、不一致的语义和无固定特征顺序，这使得构建通用模型以跨数据集利用信息变得困难。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的置换不变Transformer和语义基础模块，通过自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例学习跨数据集特征依赖。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，并支持在开放世界设置中成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

### [203] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造设计新的LLM架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM架构多为线性或混合专家模型，缺乏基于范畴论的通用构造设计。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用性质（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）构建新型LLM架构，并验证其完备性和拓扑结构。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴的完备性，并构建了一个“类集合”的拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论方法，为LLM设计提供了新的理论框架和实现路径。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [204] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于topos范畴的因果模型（TCMs），利用其完备性和其他性质，解决了复杂因果图的近似求解和干预问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果模型在处理复杂因果图和干预操作时存在局限性，需要一种更具表达力的建模框架。

Method: 提出了一种基于topos范畴的因果模型，利用其完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象等性质，实现了因果干预、近似求解和等价类推理。

Result: 证明了TCMs的范畴是完备的，能够通过（共）极限求解任意因果图，并展示了子对象分类器和指数对象在因果干预和等价类推理中的应用。

Conclusion: Topos因果模型（TCMs）通过利用topos范畴的关键性质，为因果推断提供了新的建模工具，能够处理复杂因果图的近似求解和干预操作。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合多目标算法和目标规划的方法，用于解决具有相似适应度景观的多目标问题实例，以在短时间内获得良好的近似解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，决策者需要在多个冲突目标下评估解的质量，而现代多目标算法在处理高度约束的多目标问题时仍面临困难。

Method: 通过使用计算密集型多目标算法解决一个问题实例，获得良好的近似解，然后利用目标规划和高效单目标算法解决同一问题场景的其他实例。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题基准实例上，该方法能够在短时间内产生良好的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了先进多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于具有相似适应度景观的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [206] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-BI automates Bayesian workflows by using LLMs to specify priors and likelihoods, validated through experiments on Bayesian linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of specifying prior distributions and likelihoods in Bayesian inference, which often requires specialized statistical expertise.

Method: The paper introduces LLM-BI, a conceptual pipeline for automating Bayesian workflows, and presents two experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression.

Result: Experiment I shows LLMs can elicit prior distributions from natural language, and Experiment II demonstrates LLMs can specify the entire model structure from a high-level problem description.

Conclusion: LLMs have the potential to automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling an automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [207] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FATA 是一种新的交互范式，通过主动生成补充问题提升 LLMs 的响应质量，实验证明其效果优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 LLMs 在用户提供信息不完整或模糊时响应不准确的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的交互范式 FATA，通过提示词引导 LLMs 主动生成补充问题，并结合用户反馈生成最终响应。

Result: FATA 在综合指标上比基线提示（B-Prompt）提升了约 40%，且变异系数比上下文增强专家提示（C-Prompt）低 8%，表现出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: FATA 通过主动生成多维补充问题并整合用户反馈，显著提升了 LLMs 的响应质量和相关性，同时减少了对话轮次，提高了效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估KG-RAG方法的新基准和协议，揭示了当前方法在知识不完整情况下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法区分模型是通过推理还是直接检索回答问题，且评估指标不一致，导致难以进行有意义的比较。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准的通用方法及评估协议，用于系统评估知识不完整情况下的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，常依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的评估方法和改进的KG-RAG设计，以提升其在知识不完整情况下的推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一种基于LLM的AI模型，通过微调在卡牌游戏中实现了66.2%的准确率，展示了LLMs在卡牌游戏AI中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卡牌游戏的部分可观测性、长期决策和不断变化的卡牌集，现有AI模型在卡牌游戏任务中表现远不如人类玩家。

Method: 通过低秩适应（Low-Rank Adaptation）微调开放权重的LLM，利用标注的卡牌游戏日志数据集。

Result: UrzaGPT在零样本LLMs和领域专用模型之间的表现中取得了66.2%的准确率，而GPT-4o的零样本表现仅为43%。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs（如UrzaGPT）可以实现高性能、通用且易于更新的卡牌游戏AI，尽管目前尚未达到领域专用模型的水平。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MAB的MCTS高效实现，通过双层修改和树折叠技术，解决了节点选择的时间复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中节点选择的时间复杂度较高，尤其是在搜索深度大的情况下，影响了整体效率。

Method: 提出双层MCTS修改，结合最佳优先搜索和树折叠技术，优化节点选择和动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的瓶颈问题，为高效搜索提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过使用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，从而显著加快编译速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译过程中会生成所有组合，并通过部分评估丢弃不必要的组合，这在大多数组合无关的问题中效率低下。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了将高级用户模型转换为求解器就绪形式的效率，特别是在归纳变量范围大且具有选择性前提条件的情况下。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段，优化大型语言模型的推理效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理阶段面临高成本问题，尤其是解码阶段对长序列的延迟影响显著。

Method: OverFill采用全模型进行预填充，随后切换到密集剪枝模型进行解码，以优化计算资源的使用。

Result: OverFill的3B-to-1B配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B-to-3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%。

Conclusion: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理效率和质量，同时减少了训练数据的需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，用于解决触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP），在60秒内取得了接近最优解的结果，并在MESS 2024竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入了动态弧成本，适用于仓库操作等场景。现有方法难以高效解决此类问题，因此需要开发新算法。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索的GRASP元启发式算法，构造阶段使用MIP技术将TA-TSP转化为定制TSP实例，改进阶段应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate算子。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例中，平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%；在合成数据集上，解比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。算法在MESS 2024中排名前三。

Conclusion: 该算法适用于具有状态依赖旅行成本的实际路由应用，展示了其在实时场景中的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿）来优化模型偏好，并通过实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术依赖序数偏好数据（如二元选择），但这类数据无法系统性地恢复最优模型，因为缺乏解决权衡所需的信息（如事实错误修正与风格改进的权衡）。

Method: 通过收集25,000条基数判断数据（采用支付意愿方法），将基数反馈融入偏好微调中，以优化模型选择。

Result: 实验表明，基于基数反馈的方法能更有效地优先处理高影响力改进，并在Arena-Hard等下游基准上优于仅依赖序数数据的方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是解决LLM对齐中偏好权衡问题的关键，未来工作应关注更丰富的反馈形式以进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Result: LLM在验证不确定对应关系方面表现出可行性，并与模拟Oracle进行了对比。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，验证不确定的对应关系，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM是一个基于视频游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和问题解决能力，揭示了其在空间推理和基本规划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试缺乏对空间推理和问题解决能力的评估，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架，使用ASCII字符表示游戏场景，并定义可解释的指标（如有效步骤比例、步骤效率和总分）来评估模型行为。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和基本规划方面存在持续局限性，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，尤其在代理行为和上下文推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规的限制，获取真实医疗数据存在困难，而现有合成数据生成方法缺乏系统化的提示策略和全面的评估框架。

Method: SynLLM 是一个模块化框架，利用 20 种开源 LLMs（如 LLaMA、Mistral 和 GPT 变体）生成高质量的合成医疗表格数据，并通过四种不同的提示类型（从示例驱动到基于规则的约束）控制生成过程。

Result: 在三个公共医疗数据集上的实验表明，提示工程显著影响数据质量和隐私风险，基于规则的提示在隐私与质量之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SynLLM 框架通过精心设计的提示和全面的评估标准，证明了 LLMs 能够生成既符合临床逻辑又保护隐私的合成医疗数据，为医疗研究中的数据共享提供了更安全有效的途径。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性不足，现有监督学习方法在零样本泛化方面存在挑战。

Method: 引入无监督网格自适应和局部几何特征学习，开发了物理约束的M-Uniform损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，UGM2N在多种PDE和网格几何中表现优越，具有多尺度扩展性和无网格纠缠的误差减少。

Conclusion: UGM2N是一种高效、通用的网格自适应方法，适用于多种物理系统和几何拓扑。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP（Answer Set Programming）在处理大规模Herbrand宇宙时面临基础程序规模过大的问题，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入“diminution”概念，定义为Herbrand宇宙的子集，用于生成简化后的基础程序，并通过特定编码和现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间，并降低85%的基础文件大小。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，能够显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods struggle with the sparsity and heterogeneity of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and feature costs.

Method: A novel personalized, online, and cost-aware feature selection framework tailored for EHR datasets, incorporating budgetary constraints and feature variability costs.

Result: The framework manages sparse and multimodal data robustly, supporting physicians' decision-making by incrementally acquiring informative features within budget constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed personalized, online, and cost-aware feature selection framework effectively addresses the challenges of sparsity and heterogeneity in EHR data, enhancing diagnostic confidence and resource utilization in healthcare.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a lightweight, deployable solution for evaluating procedural communication compliance in safety-critical domains, where adherence to checklists reflects operational competence.

Method: The paper introduces Prompt-and-Check, a method using context-rich prompts with open-source LLMs (e.g., LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B) to assess compliance with checklist items based on transcribed verbal exchanges. The approach is tested in a maritime domain case study.

Result: The results show that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without task-specific training, with model outputs assessed against expert-annotated ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that prompt-based inference with open-source LLMs can effectively evaluate procedural communication compliance in simulation-based training, offering a lightweight and deployable solution without requiring task-specific training.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Conclusion: 该混合机制有效提升了元启发式算法的性能，展示了在CVRP中的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳，且输出冗长，需要改进推理拓扑结构。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，结合TopoAug数据增强和强化学习，优化模型推理拓扑和输出效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，STELAR-Vision显著提升准确性，并优于大型模型，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效学习，显著提升多模态任务性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于社会认知理论的统一框架，用于设计基于大型语言模型的社会智能体，通过动机、行动规划和学习模块，显著提升了智能体在不同社会情境中的行为一致性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Motivation: 当前AR代理在支持复杂多步骤场景时表现不佳，无法有效利用用户的历史交互数据。

Method: 提出了一个包含感知、记忆、时空推理和执行模块的框架。

Result: 框架通过学习和适应用户的长期经验，提供个性化任务辅助。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动更智能的AR系统发展，以结合用户历史与自适应任务辅助。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查主要关注知识编辑的机制（如参数修改或外部存储），而忽略了被编辑知识的功能，导致对编辑效果的评估不够全面。

Method: 论文引入了一种基于知识功能的分类法，将知识分为事实性、时间性、概念性、常识性和社会性等类型，并结合编辑机制进行综合分析。

Result: 通过这种双轴分类法，论文总结了现有方法的优缺点，并展示了不同编辑机制在不同知识类型上的适用性和局限性。

Conclusion: 论文为知识编辑领域提供了更全面的视角，并指出了未来研究方向，包括如何更有效地编辑不同类型知识以及解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，现有的链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏标准化的评估协议和基准资源。

Method: 提出了GRainsaCK，一个模块化和可扩展的软件资源，通过函数化主要组件来简化解释的评估流程。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化，并提供了详细文档和教程。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释评估的空白，促进了方法的可复用性和比较性。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

Conclusion: E-Agent 通过创新规划和执行机制，有效解决了 mRAG 的实时性和效率问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

Conclusion: 人类集体智慧和人类-AI协作是发展情感智能AI的最有前景路径。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

### [233] [Reducing Cognitive Load in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Problem Solving: Decoupling Reasoning and Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882)
*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-agent framework separates reasoning and coding tasks, reducing cognitive interference and improving accuracy in mathematical reasoning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address cognitive load interference in single-agent systems, where interleaving reasoning and coding tasks leads to fewer correct reasoning paths.

Method: The proposed method involves a dual-agent framework: a Reasoning Agent for problem decomposition and a Code Agent for code generation and execution. Training combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning, with specific rewards for each agent.

Result: The results show that the dual-agent framework produces significantly more correct reasoning paths compared to the single-agent approach.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a dual-agent hybrid framework, separating reasoning and coding tasks, reduces cognitive interference and improves coordination, leading to more accurate results.

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,

risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the

costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the

Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal

vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及不确定性表达（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验，发现PT在LLMs中的适用性不一致，尤其是当不确定性以不同语言形式表达时。

Motivation: 探索前景理论在当代大型语言模型中的适用性，以及不确定性表达（如“可能”）对其决策行为的影响。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出更通用和精确的评估框架，结合不确定性表达的概率值。

Result: 前景理论在LLMs中的建模并不总是可靠，尤其是当不确定性以不同语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs中的应用存在局限性，不确定性表达形式对其决策行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

### [238] [Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019)
*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new method uses mechanistic interpretability to detect and mitigate biases in LLMs by training probes and applying steering vectors, improving model safety and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical safety concern of LLMs perpetuating harmful biases, moving beyond traditional opaque methods like data filtering or post-hoc moderation.

Method: The method involves two stages: (1) training linear probes on internal activations to detect bias representations, and (2) computing steering vectors to actively mitigate biased outputs during inference.

Result: Experiments on 	exttt{gpt2-large} show that probes can detect bias with near-perfect accuracy, and steering vectors successfully reduce biased completions in real-time.

Conclusion: The paper presents an end-to-end system for identifying and mitigating biases in large language models (LLMs) using mechanistic interpretability. The method involves training probes to detect biases and using steering vectors to actively reduce harmful outputs, offering a more direct and interpretable approach to improving LLM safety.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出FiXGBoost模型，首次研究了乘客请求前的等待时间预测问题，通过需求与供给动态分析，实现了高准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注请求后的等待时间预测，而请求前的预测对乘客行程规划和提升体验同样重要，但尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种基于特征交互的XGBoost模型（FiXGBoost），用于预测乘客请求前的等待时间，并通过重要性分析量化各因素的贡献。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集（超过3000万条记录）上，FiXGBoost模型表现出良好的预测性能和解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost模型在预测乘客请求前的等待时间方面表现出色，并具有高解释性，为乘客和司机提供了更好的体验。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中，方法达到99.31%的准确率，并在异常出现1%内完成检测。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展适用于全球部署的轨道电路，提升铁路系统的操作可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Motivation: 现有方法无法可靠地追踪生成内容的来源（预训练、外部检索或用户输入），导致隐私泄露责任不明确。

Method: 提出了Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA)，通过零阶优化和跨模态归因技术，在半黑盒设置下实现细粒度的来源追踪。

Result: SMA能够有效区分生成内容的来源，并首次实现了对图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，将关注点从‘数据是否被记忆’转向‘内容来源何处’。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified基准测试中平均成功率为34.8%，超过开源模型和OpenAI CUA（GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: OpenCUA为计算机使用代理研究提供了开放的基础设施和模型，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代理在搜索广度和推理深度上存在局限，无法平衡广泛搜索与策略推理。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，采用程序增强的规划器-执行器代理对，规划器制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster分别获得30.0和46.5分，优于开源和专有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂、重推理的信息搜索任务中表现出色，解决了现有代理的局限性。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Conclusion: EndoAgent通过双记忆设计和统一推理循环，显著提升了内窥镜图像诊断的灵活性和推理能力，优于现有通用和医学多模态模型。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general

TL;DR: Fier是一种细粒度且高效的KV缓存检索方法，通过1位量化键估计每个令牌的重要性，显著提高了长上下文LLM推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存读取延迟随上下文长度显著增加，现有方法（如KV驱逐和KV检索）在处理稀疏分布的重要令牌时效率不足。

Method: 提出Fier方法，使用1位量化键估计令牌重要性，实现高效且精确的KV缓存检索。

Result: 实验表明，Fier仅需11%的缓存预算即可匹配完整KV性能，解码延迟降低1.2倍至1.5倍。

Conclusion: Fier通过细粒度检索显著提升了长上下文任务的效率，为KV缓存管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

Conclusion: SRP通过全面捕捉依赖关系，提升了关系数据库的预测能力，并提供了实用的模型行为分析。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

*Wenqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文通过跨栈优化方法提升ML系统效率，涵盖RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统，提出多项创新解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂且硬件环境快速演变，传统方法难以高效支持，需从多层面协同优化。

Method: 采用跨栈方法，包括算法层面的PipeRAG、系统层面的RAGO和硬件层面的Chameleon，以及针对向量搜索和推荐系统的优化方案。

Result: 提出了多项创新工作，如PipeRAG、RAGO、Chameleon、FANNS、Falcon、MicroRec和FleetRec，显著提升了系统效率。

Conclusion: 该论文通过跨栈方法（算法、系统和硬件）提升机器学习系统效率，特别是在RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统等领域提出了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

TL;DR: Tagore是一个基于GPU加速的图索引库，通过GNN-Descent算法和CFS计算过程显著提升了高维向量近似最近邻搜索的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图索引在高维向量近似最近邻搜索中表现优异，但其索引开销大且动态调整需求增加，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出GNN-Descent算法加速k-NN图初始化，设计CFS通用计算过程和GPU内核支持多种剪枝策略，并开发异步GPU-CPU-磁盘索引框架。

Result: 在7个真实数据集上，Tagore实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速，同时保持索引质量。

Conclusion: Tagore通过GPU加速和优化算法显著提升了图索引的构建效率，适用于大规模高维数据。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了语义单元框架（Semantic Units Framework），一种领域无关的语义建模方法，用于生态数据和知识，支持FAIR和CLEAR原则，促进数据互操作性和因果推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态研究中异构数据集和知识的整合面临数据类型、术语和文档差异的挑战，阻碍了互操作性、重用和因果理解。

Method: 提出语义单元框架，将数据和知识建模为模块化、逻辑感知的语义单元（陈述单元和复合单元），使用RDF、OWL和知识图实现。

Result: 框架支持构建生态因果网络，支持因果推理、混杂因素检测、效应识别，并与贝叶斯网络、结构方程模型等对齐。

Conclusion: 语义单元框架为生态知识合成、证据注释、跨领域整合和可重复工作流提供了基础，支持AI-ready的生态研究。

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

### [250] [E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09023)

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite是一个基于LLM的SQL查询重写框架，通过上下文构造模块和强化学习框架，生成可执行、等效且高效的查询，显著提升了重写成功率和查询执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的SQL查询重写方法在处理复杂查询和新模式时效果不佳，且难以覆盖所有有效重写策略。

Method: 提出E3-Rewrite框架，结合执行计划和检索演示构建上下文提示，并通过强化学习优化重写目标（可执行性、等效性和效率）。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，重写成功率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite通过LLM和强化学习的结合，克服了传统方法的局限性，显著提升了SQL查询重写的效果。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

*Jim O'Connor,Jay B. Nash,Derin Gezgin,Gary B. Parker*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种通过稀疏余弦变换降低输入空间维度的进化学习方法，在Atari游戏中表现优于传统进化方法和简单强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏领域的大状态空间对进化方法提出了挑战，因为输入状态扩大时，策略的参数量也会增加，导致搜索空间指数级增长，影响收敛速度。

Method: SCOPE利用离散余弦变换（DCT）作为伪注意力机制，将输入状态转换为系数矩阵，并通过截断和稀疏化降低维度，同时保留原始输入的高能量特征。

Result: 在Atari游戏Space Invaders中，SCOPE结合CMA-ES算法，输入空间减少53%，性能优于OpenAI-ES、HyperNEAT、DQN和A3C等方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过降低输入空间维度并保留关键特征，有效提升了进化方法在游戏领域的性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

TL;DR: SafeKV 是一个隐私感知的 KV-cache 管理框架，通过选择性共享非敏感条目和隔离敏感内容，显著提升了 LLM 推理的性能和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全局 KV-cache 共享优化虽然加速了 LLM 推理，但引入了新的时序侧信道攻击风险，而现有的防御方法（如用户隔离）会显著降低性能。

Method: SafeKV 包含三个组件：混合多级检测管道、统一的基数树索引和基于熵的访问监控，以选择性共享非敏感条目并隔离敏感内容。

Result: SafeKV 减轻了 94%-97% 的时序侧信道攻击，相比用户隔离方法，TTFT 提升了 40.58%，吞吐量提升了 2.66 倍。

Conclusion: SafeKV 在保持高性能的同时，为 LLM 推理提供了强大的运行时隐私保障。

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的IC伪装方法，通过AIG-VAE实现功能保留和外观模仿的双层伪装，有效抵御物理逆向工程攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IC伪装技术多关注局部门修改，缺乏全面欺骗策略，无法有效应对逆向工程攻击。

Method: 采用AIG-VAE编码电路表示，引入新型隐蔽门（假反相器、假缓冲器和通用发射器）实现功能保留和外观模仿。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持电路功能的同时，实现了高伪装和相似性评分，且结构开销最小。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了硬件安全中模仿欺骗的空白，为IC伪装设定了新标准。

Abstract: Integrated circuits (ICs) are essential to modern electronic systems, yet
they face significant risks from physical reverse engineering (RE) attacks that
compromise intellectual property (IP) and overall system security. While IC
camouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches
largely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive
deception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning
(ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception
principles to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel
And-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit
representations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional
preservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert
gates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our
methodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while
presenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while
achieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural
overhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against
advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its
practical applicability in securing IC designs. By bridging the gap in mimetic
deception for hardware security, our work sets a new standard for IC
camouflage, advancing the application of cyber deception principles to protect
critical systems from adversarial threats.

Motivation: 现有研究局限于特定领域或AI元素，难以理解AI安全相关技术、攻击、防御和风险之间的关系及其对利益相关者的负面影响。

Method: 开发了一个AI安全地图，包含信息系统方面（ISA）和外部影响方面（EIA），分类并识别了各元素的负面影响。

Result: 通过AI安全地图，可以理解潜在负面影响及其原因和应对措施，并展示了新发现。

Conclusion: AI安全地图为未来AI安全社区提供了指导建议和开放性问题。

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

*Aydin Zaboli,Junho Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GenAI-based anomaly detection system for IEC61850 digital substations, using AATM for dataset generation and ToD for improved detection, outperforming traditional ML-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems in addressing cybersecurity challenges in IEC61850-based digital substations, especially with the integration of advanced communication protocols like GOOSE, which introduce vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.

Method: The research leverages generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust anomaly detection systems (ADSs), incorporating the advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique for dataset generation and task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes for improved attack pattern detection.

Result: The results demonstrate that the GenAI-based ADSs, using AATM-generated datasets, outperform traditional ML-based ADSs in detecting attack patterns, as validated by standard and advanced performance evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed GenAI-based ADSs, combined with the AATM technique, outperform traditional ML-based ADSs in detecting cyber threats in IEC61850-based digital substations, providing a more robust solution for modern smart grids.

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Double extortion ransomware attacks have become mainstream since many
organizations adopt more robust and resilient data backup strategies against
conventional crypto-ransomware. This paper presents detailed attack stages,
tactics, procedures, and tools used in the double extortion ransomware attacks.
We then present a novel detection method using low-level storage and memory
behavioral features and network traffic features obtained from a thin
hypervisor to establish a defense-in-depth strategy for when attackers
compromise OS-level protection. We employed the lightweight \emph{Kitsune}
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)'s network feature to detect the data
exfiltration phase in double extortion ransomware attacks. Our experimental
results showed that the presented method improved by 0.166 in the macro F score
of the data exfiltration phase detection rate. Lastly, we discuss the
limitations of the presented method and future work.

Conclusion: 研究表明，攻击者能够通过控制勒索软件的行为特征有效降低检测率，突显了对抗样本在网络安全中的威胁。

Abstract: Protecting state-of-the-art AI-based cybersecurity defense systems from cyber
attacks is crucial. Attackers create adversarial examples by adding small
changes (i.e., perturbations) to the attack features to evade or fool the deep
learning model. This paper introduces the concept of low-level behavioral
adversarial examples and its threat model of evasive ransomware. We formulate
the method and the threat model to generate the optimal source code of evasive
malware. We then examine the method using the leaked source code of Conti
ransomware with the micro-behavior control function. The micro-behavior control
function is our test component to simulate changing source code in ransomware;
ransomware's behavior can be changed by specifying the number of threads, file
encryption ratio, and delay after file encryption at the boot time. We
evaluated how much an attacker can control the behavioral features of
ransomware using the micro-behavior control function to decrease the detection
rate of a ransomware detector.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于跨度概念的DP-DBSCAN替代定义，并通过实验和理论验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP).
Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input
points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach
cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an
alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that
publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and
classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm
achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as
matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our
algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under
pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of
our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has expanded its capabilities across domains, yet
introduced critical technical vulnerabilities, such as algorithmic bias and
adversarial sensitivity, that pose significant societal risks, including
misinformation, inequity, security breaches, physical harm, and eroded public
trust. These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We
propose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal
dimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security
(system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and
Social Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach
unifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights
to promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a
systematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1)
the generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2)
inadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3)
fragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings
stem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational
design principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address
the interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome
this, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor
with social responsibility. Our framework offers actionable guidance for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers to develop AI systems that are not
only robust and secure but also ethically aligned and publicly trustworthy. The

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

Conclusion: 报告总结了可编辑区块链的未来潜力，特别是在构建合规、可信和可扩展的数字基础设施方面的应用。

Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides
robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same
feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require
regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive
information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones
by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily
through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and
alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for
introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable
secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special
attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in
private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance,
Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines
further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the
future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant,
trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.

Motivation: 随着数字数据传输规模的扩大，隐私问题日益紧迫，但隐私仍是一个社会构建且模糊定义的概念，缺乏普遍接受的定量测量。

Method: 研究了互信息（MI）估计器（特别是经验估计器和MINE框架）在检测选择性加密图像泄漏中的应用。

Result: 研究表明，稳健的估计器需要能够捕捉空间依赖性和残差结构的概率框架，即使在加密表示中也是如此。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图像信息泄漏估计提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EditMF是一种无需训练的方法，通过语义连贯的三元组嵌入指纹，实现高效且隐蔽的LLM所有权验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权（IP）是重要但资源密集的任务，现有方法在隐蔽性和效率上存在不足。

Method: 利用加密的人工知识库中的三元组（如作者-小说-主角），通过因果追踪和零空间更新嵌入指纹。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上，EditMF实现了高隐蔽性和低性能损失，且验证仅需单次黑盒查询。

Conclusion: EditMF是一种高效、低开销的LLM所有权验证解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

Motivation: 随着物联网设备的普及，电网面临负载改变攻击（LAA）的威胁，可能导致频率波动甚至电网不稳定。研究旨在填补学术研究与实际应用之间的空白，为电网运营商提供应对策略。

Method: 使用DIgSILENT PowerFactory进行仿真，基于英国国家电力系统运营商（NESO）发布的GB-36 Zone模型，评估不同LAA场景对电网的影响，并分析BESS的快速频率响应服务的效果。

Result: 研究确定了电网在触发级联效应前可容忍的LAA严重程度阈值，并揭示了BESS与LAA相对位置以及攻击执行延迟对系统响应的显著影响。

Conclusion: 该论文通过实际电网模型和开源数据集，评估了负载改变攻击（LAA）对电网频率稳定性的影响，并探讨了电池储能系统（BESS）在缓解此类攻击中的作用。研究为电网运营商提供了关于LAA影响和BESS部署策略的实用见解。

Abstract: The growing digitalization and the rapid adoption of high-powered
Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices (e.g., EV charging stations) have
increased the vulnerability of power grids to cyber threats. In particular, the
so-called Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) can trigger rapid frequency fluctuations
and potentially destabilize the power grid. This paper aims to bridge the gap
between academic research and practical application by using open-source
datasets released by grid operators. It investigates various LAA scenarios on a
real-world transmission network, namely the Great Britain (GB)-36 Zone model
released by the UK's National Electricity System Operator (NESO). It evaluates
the threshold of LAA severity that the grid can tolerate before triggering
cascading effects. Additionally, it explores how Battery Energy Storage Systems
(BESS) based fast frequency response services can mitigate or prevent such
impacts. Simulations are conducted using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to ensure
realistic system representation. The analysis provides several useful insights
to grid operators on the LAA impact, such as the influence of the relative
locations of BESS and LAA, as well as how delays in attack execution can
influence the overall system response.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在敏感环境中的部署增加，指纹攻击对隐私和安全构成重大风险，需要研究攻防方法。

Method: 攻击方法使用强化学习自动优化查询选择；防御方法通过次级LLM进行语义保留的输出过滤。

Result: 攻击方法仅用3个查询即优于随机选择；防御方法在保持输出质量的同时降低了指纹识别精度。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

TL;DR: 论文分析了边缘计算中GPU资源利用不足的问题，通过多维度指标识别瓶颈，并提出优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备增多和网络技术进步推动了对边缘实时数据处理的需求，但GPU在边缘计算中的资源利用不足，缺乏深入理解。

Method: 通过分析高、低层次指标（如GPU利用率、内存使用、SM利用率等），结合多种分析工具，全面评估NVIDIA Jetson设备在并发视觉推理任务中的资源行为。

Result: 研究发现，尽管GPU利用率可达100%，但关键低层次资源（如SM和张量核心）利用率仅为15%-30%，且CPU端事件（如线程调度）常成为瓶颈。

Conclusion: 论文提供了对NVIDIA边缘设备上视觉推理任务的关键观察，为硬件感知优化提供了指导。

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

TL;DR: 本文通过联邦学习策略在5G边缘场景中测试吞吐量预测，发现FedBN在非独立同分布数据下表现最佳，LSTM和Transformer优于CNN，并在实际应用中显著提升QoE分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G网络中，准确和自适应的网络吞吐量预测对延迟敏感和带宽密集型应用至关重要，但现有方法在异构移动环境中适用性有限。

Method: 评估了三种聚合算法（FedAvg、FedProx、FedBN）和四种时间序列架构（LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM、Transformer），使用了五个真实世界数据集，并分析了客户端异构性、队列大小和历史窗口长度对性能的影响。

Result: FedBN在非独立同分布条件下表现稳健；LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上优于CNN基线80%；FedBN-based LSTM和Transformer模型在自适应流媒体中分别提升QoE分数11.7%和11.4%。

Conclusion: 本文通过联邦学习策略在5G边缘场景中进行了全面的吞吐量预测基准测试，发现FedBN在非独立同分布数据条件下表现稳健，LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上优于CNN基线。FedBN-based LSTM和Transformer模型在自适应流媒体管道中显著提升了QoE分数。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于强化学习的自适应调度方法在多租户分布式系统中表现出色，显著提升了任务延迟控制、资源效率和公平性，具有实际工程价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

Motivation: 云端解码阶段生成过多令牌会长期占用资源，影响吞吐量；设备端资源有限导致预填充阶段延迟（TTFT）随提示长度增加而显著上升。

Method: 将大型语言模型在云端和设备端分离，云端仅在预填充阶段协助设备端，设备端在接收到第一个令牌后立即响应用户，后续令牌通过速度控制器平滑呈现。

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案有效解决了资源瓶颈问题，显著提升了性能，并通过算法优化进一步确定了最佳设置。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

Motivation: 传统的$L_0$-平滑条件对现代任务（如深度学习）限制较大，而$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑条件在集中式优化中已显示出优势，但其在去中心化优化中的扩展尚未探索。

Method: 通过引入新颖的分析技术，提出了一个去中心化梯度下降（DGD）框架，并在确定性和随机性设置下分别实现了最佳收敛率和复杂度界限。

Result: 在确定性设置中，该方法在无需预先知道$L_0$和$L_1$的情况下，实现了凸/非凸函数的最佳收敛率；在随机设置中，推导了复杂度界限并识别了改进条件。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个在$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑条件下的去中心化梯度下降（DGD）通用框架，填补了该领域的空白，并通过实证验证了梯度范数依赖的平滑性，为理论和实践搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: $L_0$-smoothness, which has been pivotal to advancing decentralized
optimization theory, is often fairly restrictive for modern tasks like deep
learning. The recent advent of relaxed $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness condition enables
improved convergence rates for gradient methods. Despite centralized advances,
its decentralized extension remains unexplored and challenging. In this work,
we propose the first general framework for decentralized gradient descent (DGD)
under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness by introducing novel analysis techniques. For
deterministic settings, our method with adaptive clipping achieves the
best-known convergence rates for convex/nonconvex functions without prior
knowledge of $L_0$ and $L_1$ and bounded gradient assumption. In stochastic
settings, we derive complexity bounds and identify conditions for improved
complexity bound in convex optimization. The empirical validation with real
datasets demonstrates gradient-norm-dependent smoothness, bridging theory and
practice for $(L_0,L_1)$-decentralized optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: 滑模技术与极值搜索控制的结合为实时、无模型优化提供了新思路，牛顿法在性能上更具优势。

Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient
convergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode
techniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and
more recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a
new framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based
ESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies
in the use of discontinuous "relay-type" control components, replacing
traditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic
nonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the
first attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes
within the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach,
the convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective
function. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by
employing a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a
Riccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the
closed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging
Lyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with
discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed
method, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness
compared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only
exponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based
method exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient
trajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the
Newton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall
performance going straightly to the extremum.

Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal
control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state
probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given
deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this
work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine
Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a
quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This
complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential
in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in
nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering
(transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic
scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process
noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing
medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections
between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the
lens of quantum mechanics.

joint perimeter control and route guidance (MSJC) framework for controlling
traffic in large-scale networks. The network is first partitioned into several
subnetworks (regions) with traffic in each region governed by its macroscopic
fundamental diagram (MFD), which forms the macroscale network (upper level).
Each subnetwork, comprised of actual road links and signalized intersections,
forms the microscale network (lower level). At the upper level, a joint
perimeter control and route guidance model solves the region-based inflow rate
and hyper-path flows to control the accumulation of each region and thus
maximize the throughput of each region. At the lower level, a perimeter control
strategy integrated with a backpressure policy determines the optimal signal
phases of the intersections at the regional boundary. At the same time, a route
choice model for vehicles is constructed to meet hyper-path flows and ensure
the intra-region homogeneity of traffic density. The case study results
demonstrate that the proposed MSJC outperforms other benchmarks in regulating
regional accumulation, thereby improving throughput.

Conclusion: 所提算法在拜占庭攻击下表现出色，理论分析和实验验证均支持其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized online resource
allocation in the presence of Byzantine attacks. In this problem setting, some
agents may be compromised due to external manipulations or internal failures,
causing them to behave maliciously and disrupt the resource allocation process
by sending incorrect messages to their neighbors. Given the non-consensual
nature of the resource allocation problem, we formulate it under a primal-dual
optimization framework, where the dual variables are aggregated among the
agents, enabling the incorporation of robust aggregation mechanisms to mitigate
Byzantine attacks. By leveraging the classical Byzantine attack model, we
propose a class of Byzantine-resilient decentralized online resource allocation
algorithms that judiciously integrate the adaptive robust clipping technique
with the existing robust aggregation rules to filter out adversarial messages.
We establish theoretical guarantees, showing that the proposed algorithms
achieve tight linear dynamic regret and accumulative constraint violation
bounds, where the constants depend on the properties of robust aggregation
rules. Numerical experiments on decentralized online economic dispatch validate
the effectiveness of our approach and support our theoretical results.

Motivation: 传统分支定界方法在处理QOBLIB市场分割问题时表现有限（仅能处理m=7的实例），而GPU实现的Schroeppel-Shamir算法也只能处理到m=11。因此，需要更高效的算法来解决更大规模的实例。

Method: 将市场分割问题转化为格问题，并应用作者的算法进行求解。

Result: 作者的算法在标准计算机上成功解决了QOBLIB中m=14的市场分割问题实例。

Conclusion: 作者的算法通过将市场分割问题转化为格问题，成功解决了QOBLIB中规模更大的实例（m=14），优于传统方法和GPU实现的Schroeppel-Shamir算法。

Abstract: The market split problem was proposed by Cornu\'ejols and Dawande in 1998 as
benchmark problem for algorithms solving linear systems with binary variables.
The recent (2025) Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library (QOBLIB) contains a
set of feasible instances of the market split problem.
  The market split problem seems to be difficult to solve with the conventional
branch-and-bound approach of integer linear programming software which
reportedly can handle QOBLIB instances up to $m=7$. In contrast, a new GPU
implementation of the Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm solves instances up to
$m=11$.
  In this short note we report about experiments with our algorithm that
reduces the market split problem to a lattice problem. The author's most recent
implementation solvediophant applied to the QOBLIB market split instances can
solve instances up to $m=14$ on a standard computer.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 研究共享自动驾驶汽车（SAVs）的规模经济对交通系统效率的影响，发现边际成本定价降低通勤成本但导致赤字，平均成本定价在适当时机实施效果最佳，且最优政策可限制SAVs的过度使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究共享自动驾驶汽车（SAVs）的规模经济如何影响与普通车辆（NVs）共存的交通系统效率，探讨不同定价策略对通勤成本和财务可持续性的影响。

Method: 通过建立瓶颈模型，分析通勤者在共享自动驾驶汽车（SAVs）和普通车辆（NVs）之间的出行选择和出发时间，并比较三种SAV定价情景（边际成本定价、平均成本定价和垄断定价）下的均衡。

Result: 边际成本定价降低通勤成本但导致财务赤字；平均成本定价在适当时机实施可促进高采用率并降低成本；扩大道路容量可能增加通勤成本；最优政策可限制SAVs的过度使用。

Conclusion: 边际成本定价虽能降低通勤成本但会导致财务赤字，而平均成本定价在适当时机实施可促进共享自动驾驶汽车（SAVs）的高采用率并显著降低成本。此外，扩大道路容量在平均成本定价下可能增加通勤成本，体现了Downs-Thomson悖论。最优政策（如边际成本定价与拥堵收费结合）可限制SAVs的过度使用，表明推广SAVs并不总能降低社会成本。

Abstract: This study examines how scale economies in the operation of shared autonomous
vehicles (SAVs) affect the efficiency of a transportation system where SAVs
coexist with normal vehicles (NVs). We develop a bottleneck model where
commuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs,
and analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing,
average-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing
reduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service
provider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has
contrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the
existence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages
adoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV
adoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and
achieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that
expanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost
pricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems
with SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost,
including the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines
marginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that
relies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can
limit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that
promoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost.

Result: RPGD在保证连续可行性的同时，减少了计算负担，并通过数值实验验证了其在市场问题和动态定价问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: RPGD是一种有效的决策依赖优化方法，优于现有方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: This paper considers the decision-dependent optimization problem, where the
data distributions react in response to decisions affecting both the objective
function and linear constraints. We propose a new method termed repeated
projected gradient descent (RPGD), which iteratively projects points onto
evolving feasible sets throughout the optimization process. To analyze the
impact of varying projection sets, we show a Lipschitz continuity property of
projections onto varying sets with an explicitly given Lipschitz constant.
Leveraging this property, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence
of RPGD to the constrained equilibrium point. Compared to the existing dual
ascent method, RPGD ensures continuous feasibility throughout the optimization
process and reduces the computational burden. We validate our results through
numerical experiments on a market problem and dynamic pricing problem.

Conclusion: 研究结果为启发式充电算法和快速无优化算法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal
objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the
case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes
computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent
heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the
computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many
heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several
special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a
constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when
the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the
heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting
Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is
bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local
controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride
behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the
monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of
the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class
of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.

Conclusion: 该论文将现有理论扩展到更一般的非光滑和随机设置，包括时变网络和鞍点问题，并建立了与凸优化和鞍点优化问题的下界相匹配的上界。

Abstract: We study non-smooth stochastic decentralized optimization problems over
time-varying networks, where objective functions are distributed across nodes
and network connections may intermittently appear or break. Specifically, we
consider two settings: (i) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex
optimization, and (ii) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex-(strongly)
concave saddle point optimization. Convex problems of this type commonly arise
in deep neural network training, while saddle point problems are central to
machine learning tasks such as the training of generative adversarial networks
(GANs). Prior works have primarily focused on the smooth setting, or
time-invariant network scenarios. We extend the existing theory to the more
general non-smooth and stochastic setting over time-varying networks and saddle
point problems. Our analysis establishes upper bounds on both the number of
stochastic oracle calls and communication rounds, matching lower bounds for
both convex and saddle point optimization problems.

Conclusion: 本文通过分析离散时间异步博弈，提出了确保收敛的严格条件，并通过数值实验验证了结果的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the discrete-time asynchronous games in which
noncooperative agents seek to minimize their individual cost functions.
Building on the assumption of partial asynchronism, i.e., each agent updates at
least once within a fixed-length time interval, we explore the conditions to
ensure convergence of such asynchronous games. The analysis begins with a
simple quadratic game from which we derive tight convergence conditions through
the lens of linear control theory. Then, we provide a quasidominance condition
for general convex games. Our results demonstrate that this condition is
stringent since when this condition is not satisfied, the asynchronous games
may fail to converge. We propose both first- and zeroth-order learning
algorithms for asynchronous games, depending on the type of available feedback,
and analyze their last-iterate convergence rates. Numerical experiments are
presented on economic market problems to verify our results.

Motivation: 组合优化问题（COP）因解空间中存在大量局部最优解而难以求解。本文旨在扩展同伦凸（HC）变换方法至UBQP，以平滑解空间并提升算法性能。

Method: 1. 构建任意大小的单峰玩具UBQP并证明其单峰性；2. 应用HC变换框架平滑原始UBQP；3. 提出LSILS迭代算法框架；4. 进一步提出并行协作变体PC-LSILS。

Conclusion: 本文成功将HC变换扩展至UBQP，提出的LSILS和PC-LSILS框架显著提升了算法性能，为COP的求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Method: 评估三种玩具UBQP（^Q1、^Q2、^Q3）的地形平坦度，并测试LSILS算法在不同玩具UBQP下的效率。

Result: ^Q1的地形最平坦，^Q3最不平坦；LSILS使用^Q2效果最佳，^Q3效果最差。

Conclusion: 研究为UBQP优化中的地形平滑技术提供了详细理解，^Q2是最有效的选择。

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

Conclusion: ICL在多类分类中表现优异，且不仅限于transformer架构，MLP也能在特定条件下实现类似效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

Conclusion: Hierarchical-CPI是一种有效的模型无关变量重要性度量方法，能够处理高相关性数据，并在神经影像数据中识别出生物学上合理的变量。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

Conclusion: 预测编码（PC）是一种有潜力的生物合理性替代方案，能够克服反向传播（BP）的局限性，并为未来研究提供了实用的实现指南。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.
