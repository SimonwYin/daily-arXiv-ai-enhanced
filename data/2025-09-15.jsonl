Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this\npaper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support\nequal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social\nsciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,\naccording to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for\na position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have\nan equal chance of landing it.

Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves\nsuperior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting\nmodels. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using\nonly 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/Leopold1423/fedbif-tpds25."}

We explore an\nalternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical\nalgorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions.

Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage.

While there exists an extensive\nliterature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local\noptimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is\nless clear.
