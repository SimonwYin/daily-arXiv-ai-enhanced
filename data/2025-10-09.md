*Thusitha Dayaratne,Ngoc Duy Pham,Viet Vo,Shangqi Lai,Sharif Abuadbba,Hajime Suzuki,Xingliang Yuan,Carsten Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 利用LLM零样本能力，通过语义完整的自然语言攻击描述对RRC/NAS控制平面流量进行异常检测，在O-RAN环境中实现实时可行且对提示短语和长度不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则和机器学习方法在控制平面异常检测上受限于大量训练数据、预定义规则和可解释性问题；利用LLM的零样本和语义理解能力，旨在构建更通用、易部署且对提示变化鲁棒的检测框架。

Method: 在RRC/NAS数据集上，将无序控制平面记录与短自然语言攻击描述作为提示输入给多种LLM（开源与专有），采用零-shot推理进行分类/检测；评估提示鲁棒性、自动描述生成，并在O-RAN实时限制下测试延迟与检测质量；与传统规则与机器学习方法比较性能。

Result: 提出并评估了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）零样本检测的RRC/NAS异常检测框架，适用于O-RAN架构，能处理无序数据与简短自然语言攻击描述；分析了对提示词变化的鲁棒性，证明自动生成攻击描述的可行性，并表明检测性能依赖于描述的语义完整性；在RRC/NAS数据集上对比了开源与专有LLM，结果显示优越的攻击检测性能；验证了在O-RAN实时约束下的实用性，并扩展到其他三层攻击检测的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM零样本检测是控制平面异常（如盲DoS）的一种可行、实用且具有良好泛化性的解决方案，关键在于保证攻击描述的语义完整性；能满足O-RAN实时约束并可扩展到其他Layer-3攻击。

Abstract: The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly
improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to
continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane
protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS),
pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that
leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these
methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training
data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these
challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered
data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio
Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation,
demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show
that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description
rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate
the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary
LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We
further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time
constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.

### [2] [Automated Repeatable Adversary Threat Emulation with Effects Language (EL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06420)
*Suresh K. Damodaran,Paul D. Rowe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出将视觉编程语言Effects Language (EL)应用于自动化仿真APT多步攻击，解决相关挑战并提高可重复性与资源效率。形式定义EL执行语义并证明执行性质，通过公开攻击场景实例化攻击编码并展示攻破证明功能，实验展示时间与资源提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步APT攻击仿真对训练与评估至关重要，但面临复杂性、可重复性、可验证性和资源开销等挑战，需一种既可视化又有形式语义保证的自动化方法。

Method: 提出并形式定义EL的图形化操作语义；证明执行性质；用公开攻击场景对攻击步骤建模并实现为EL脚本；通过实验测量时间与资源利用，展示效率提升，并生成攻破证明。

Result: 用EL编码的攻击在可重复性、时间与资源使用上显著优于传统手动或非形式化脚本，且可生成攻破证明，验证执行性质。

Conclusion: EL能满足自动化仿真多步APT攻击的关键需求：形式化执行语义、可视化建模、可重复自动化与攻破证明，从而提高训练与防护评估的效率和可证明性。

Abstract: The emulation of multi-step attacks attributed to advanced persistent threats
is valuable for training defenders and evaluating defense tools. In this paper,
we discuss the numerous challenges and desired attributes associated with such
automation. Additionally, we introduce the use of Effects Language (EL), a
visual programming language with graph-based operational semantics, as a
solution to address many of these challenges and requirements. We formally
define the execution semantics of EL, and prove important execution properties.
Furthermore, we showcase the application of EL to codify attacks using an
example from one of the publicly available attack scenarios. We also
demonstrate how EL can be utilized to provide proof-of-attack of complex
multi-step attacks. Our results highlight the improvements in time and resource
efficiency achieved through the use of EL for repeatable automation.

### [3] [GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109)
*Guan-Yan Yang,Farn Wang,Kuo-Hui Yeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出基于GNN的GNN-NAD，融合攻击图与流量特征，使用GSAGE+RF，在SDN+CFN架构下对消费电子网络异常检测表现优越，尤其小样本下效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning anomaly detectors are complex, static, require manual config, and don't leverage vulnerability context; need scalable, CFN-enabled CE network security with holistic static+dynamic features.

Method: Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection (GNN-NAD) integrating SDN and CFN

Result: Proposed GNN-NAD fuses vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features; uses GSAGE for graph representation and Random Forest classifier (GSAGE+RF); achieves superior accuracy, recall, precision, F1 even with small samples, outperforming existing methods in CE environment.

Conclusion: GNN-NAD结合静态漏洞攻击图与动态流量，实现了更准确、可扩展的消费电子网络异常检测，为下一代智能CE网络安全和效率提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible
to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise
their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities
allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the
propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device
failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems
exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly
complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual
configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and
Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network
model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection
framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN
architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph
with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security.
The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation
learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF)
demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection
methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD
achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even
with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly
detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of
next-generation intelligent CE networks.

### [4] [Breaking Precision Time: OS Vulnerability Exploits Against IEEE 1588](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06421)
*Muhammad Abdullah Soomro,Fatima Muhammad Anwar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了内核级攻击对PTP的威胁，实施三种内核攻击原语并在常用守护进程上验证，结果显示可在不篡改网络流量的情况下悄然破坏时间同步，强调需重新考虑宿主可信模型并引入内核完整性保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有针对网络层的加密和异常检测方案，但这些防御假定宿主机可信；作者认为当内核被攻破时，这些假设失效，因此需要系统性研究内核级威胁对PTP的影响。

Method: 作者提出并实现了三种内核态攻击原语（恒定偏移、渐进漂移、随机抖动），通过修改内核时间接口和相关驱动，与ptp4l和phc2sys守护进程交互验证攻击有效性，并在实验中评估对同步精度的影响。

Result: 实验表明三种攻击能在不改变PTP网络报文的情况下造成亚微秒级同步的隐蔽破坏，现有PTP安全扩展无法检测或防御此类攻击；因此需将内核完整性纳入时间同步系统设计。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了现有PTP威胁模型的盲点：内核级攻击者可在不篡改网络流量的前提下，通过破坏宿主机内核接口悄然操控系统时间，从而绕过现有PTP安全机制。

Abstract: The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), standardized as IEEE 1588, provides
sub-microsecond synchronization across distributed systems and underpins
critical infrastructure in telecommunications, finance, power systems, and
industrial automation. While prior work has extensively analyzed PTP's
vulnerability to network-based attacks, prompting the development of
cryptographic protections and anomaly detectors, these defenses presume an
uncompromised host. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical blind
spot in current threat models: kernel-level adversaries operating from within
the host running the PTP stack. We present the first systematic study of
kernel-rooted attacks on PTP, demonstrating how privileged attackers can
manipulate system time by corrupting key interfaces without altering PTP
network traffic. We implement three attack primitives, constant offset,
progressive skew, and random jitter, using in-kernel payloads, and evaluate
their impact on the widely used ptp4l and phc2sys daemons. Our experiments
reveal that these attacks can silently destabilize clock synchronization,
bypassing existing PTP security extensions. These findings highlight the urgent
need to reconsider host-level trust assumptions and integrate kernel integrity
into the design of secure time synchronization systems.

### [5] [Proofs of No Intrusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06432)
*Vipul Goyal,Justin Raizes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了“无入侵证明”（Proofs of No Intrusion），允许经典客户端远程检测量子服务器是否被入侵并窃取了数据，且测试不会破坏被测数据。作者在假设全同态加密的前提下，为密文构造了无入侵证明，并把该概念扩展到若干不可克隆原语（如不可克隆解密密钥和签名令牌）。核心技术是在经典通信下对余类态进行非破坏性测试的方法，可被看作对余类态测量结果的非破坏性知识证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上完美复制不留痕迹使得检测数据被窃取不可能，而量子力学禁止一般性复制，因此可以利用量子不可克隆性来检测是否发生了窃取——即证明服务器没有被入侵。

Method: 提出了一种在经典通信下对余类态（coset states）进行非破坏性测试的新方法，本质上是对余类态测量结果的非破坏性知识证明，并基于此构建无入侵证明；对密文的构造依赖全同态加密。

Result: 定义并构造了无入侵证明的具体实现：对密文（基于全同态加密）以及若干不可克隆原语给出无入侵证明的构造；提出了余类态的非破坏性测试技术。 

Conclusion: 可以构造出在经典客户端与量子服务器场景下的无入侵证明，使得在不破坏数据的情况下检测数据是否被窃取成为可能；该技术适用于密文（需全同态加密假设）和多种不可克隆原语。

Abstract: A central challenge in data security is not just preventing theft, but
detecting whether it has occurred. Classically, this is impossible because a
perfect copy leaves no evidence. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, forbids
general duplication, opening up new possibilities.
  We introduce Proofs of No Intrusion, which enable a classical client to
remotely test whether a quantum server has been hacked and the client's data
stolen. Crucially, the test does not destroy the data being tested, avoiding
the need to store a backup elsewhere. We define and construct proofs of no
intrusion for ciphertexts assuming fully homomorphic encryption. Additionally,
we show how to equip several constructions of unclonable primitives with proofs
of non-intrusion, such as unclonable decryption keys and signature tokens.
Conceptually, proofs of non-intrusion can be defined for essentially any
unclonable primitive.
  At the heart of our techniques is a new method for non-destructively testing
coset states with classical communication. It can be viewed as a
non-destructive proof of knowledge of a measurement result of the coset state.

### [6] [BATTLE for Bitcoin: Capital-Efficient Optimistic Bridges with Large Committees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06468)
*Sergio Demian Lerner,Ariel Futoransky*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 BATTLE for Bitcoin：在比特币 UTXO 模型下为乐观桥提供抗 DoS 的争议层，采用 BitVM 风格的 FLEX 组件、布线电路与按需 L1 押金，争议以对数轮解决并回收奖励，最低诚实申报者初始资本保持恒定，完全可竞赛，仅需标准 timelock 与预签交易 DAG，无新操作码，复杂度为 O(N^2) 预签交易/签名/消息，实用至 N≈1000。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为乐观桥（比特币与 rollup/sidechain 之间）提供一个对抗大量无许可挑战者和 DoS 攻击的争议层，减少诚实申报者在面对众多挑战者时的资本压力，同时避免对比特币协议做出修改。

Method: 将 BATTLE 锦标赛协议改造到 UTXO 模型，利用 BitVM 式的 FLEX 原语和按需 L1 押金框架来提供争议保证；争议通过对数轮的锦标赛式挑战与回合制奖励回收实现，使用布线电路（garbled circuits）和预签交易 DAG 实现 L1 可执行性与 timelocks；系统保持完全可竞赛，允许提出更高工作量的反证明。

Result: 构造在理论上能以对数轮解决争议并回收奖励，最低诚实初始资本在任意数量的挑战者下保持恒定，且实现只需标准 timelocks 与预签交易 DAG；系统需要 O(N^2) 的预签交易/签名/消息量，但在 N≈1000 仍具实用性。

Conclusion: BATTLE 提供了一个无需新增比特币原语即可实现的、对 DoS 抵抗且可高度去中心化的争议层；它在保证诚实方资本要求不随挑战者数量膨胀的同时实现可竞赛的对抗，且在 N≈10^3 时仍具可行性。

Abstract: We present BATTLE for Bitcoin, a DoS-resilient dispute layer that secures
optimistic bridges between Bitcoin and rollups or sidechains. Our design adapts
the BATTLE tournament protocol to Bitcoin's UTXO model using BitVM-style FLEX
components and garbled circuits with on-demand L1 security bonds. Disputes are
resolved in logarithmic rounds while recycling rewards, keeping the honest
asserter's minimum initial capital constant even under many permissionless
challengers. The construction is fully contestable (challengers can supply
higher-work counter-proofs) and relies only on standard timelocks and
pre-signed transaction DAGs, without new opcodes.
  For $N$ operators, the protocol requires $O(N^2)$ pre-signed transactions,
signatures, and message exchanges, yet remains practical at $N\!\gtrsim\!10^3$,
enabling high decentralization.

### [7] [SpyChain: Multi-Vector Supply Chain Attacks on Small Satellite Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06535)
*Jack Vanlyssel,Enrique Sobrados,Ramsha Anwar,Gruia-Catalin Roman,Afsah Anwar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 辅助COTS硬件可作为隐蔽且强大的供应链攻击载体，SpyChain演示了其在小卫星上的可行性与危害，需加强对硬件组件的信任边界与运行时监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小卫星广泛采用COTS硬件，但辅助组件通常缺乏严格安全保证且能访问关键资源，现有研究多聚焦飞行软件而忽视了硬件供应链的内部威胁。作者旨在揭示这些组件作为“内部人”如何被利用，以及评估其可行性、隐蔽性与危害并提出防御。

Method: 构建并实现了SpyChain——一个针对小卫星的端到端硬件供应链攻击框架；基于NASA的NOS3仿真平台进行评估；设计五种不同隐蔽性场景（从单一组件到协同行为），通过Covert Channel和多组件协作技术实现隐匿的持久化、遥测外泄与DoS；最后实现轻量级运行时监控等防御原型进行缓解验证。

Result: 在NOS3平台上实证SpyChain能够绕过测试、通过隐蔽通道外泄遥测、干扰任务并发起DoS，展示从单点到协同行为的攻击升级路径，并引入一种新型多组件执行技术被纳入SPARTA矩阵；同时证明轻量级运行时监控可检测并缓解部分攻击。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，辅助COTS硬件在小型卫星中的供应链被利用可构成高度隐蔽且有效的攻击，能够绕过传统测试与地面监控，实施遥测外泄、破坏操作和DoS等影响。研究强调需扩展安全关注范围，从飞行软件转向对辅助组件的严格保证与监控。

Abstract: Small satellites are integral to scientific, commercial, and defense
missions, but reliance on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware broadens
their attack surface. Although supply chain threats are well studied in other
cyber-physical domains, their feasibility and stealth in space systems remain
largely unexplored. Prior work has focused on flight software, which benefits
from strict security practices and oversight. In contrast, auxiliary COTS
components often lack robust assurance yet enjoy comparable access to critical
on-board resources, including telemetry, system calls, and the software bus.
Despite this privileged access, the insider threat within COTS hardware supply
chains has received little attention. In this work, we present SpyChain, the
first end-to-end design and implementation of independent and colluding
hardware supply chain threats targeting small satellites. Using NASA's
satellite simulation (NOS3), we demonstrate that SpyChain can evade testing,
exfiltrate telemetry, disrupt operations, and launch Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks through covert channels that bypass ground monitoring. Our study traces
an escalation from a simple solo component to dynamic, coordinating malware,
introducing a taxonomy of stealth across five scenarios. We showcase how
implicit trust in auxiliary components enables covert persistence and reveal
novel attack vectors, highlighting a new multi-component execution technique
that is now incorporated into the SPARTA matrix. Our findings are reinforced by
acknowledgment and affirmation from NASA's NOS3 team. Finally, we implement
lightweight onboard defenses, including runtime monitoring, to mitigate threats
like SpyChain.

### [8] [Auto-Stega: An Agent-Driven System for Lifelong Strategy Evolution in LLM-Based Text Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06565)
*Jiuan Zhou,Yu Cheng,Yuan Xie,Zhaoxia Yin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Auto-Stega是一种代理驱动的自我进化文本隐写框架，自动发现并适应隐写策略，并结合PC-DNTE算法在高嵌入率下实现更好的不可觉察性和安全性，实验证明显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大模型的文本隐写多依赖人工设计或预设策略，在效率、不可觉察性与安全性间难以兼顾，尤其在高嵌入率下表现差，因而需要自动化、可适应且能保持基模型分布一致性的方案。

Method: 构建一个闭环代理系统：策略库通过生成候选策略、用解码LLM恢复信息并评估其结果，随后总结并更新策略库；引入PC-DNTE作为即插即用算法，约束生成分布以保持与基模型一致，从而在高嵌入率下减少感知差异。

Result: 实验表明，Auto-Stega在高嵌入率下相较于最先进方法在困惑度上提升42.2%，在抗隐写检测性能上提升1.6%。

Conclusion: Auto-Stega提出了一种自主进化的文本隐写框架，通过代理循环（生成-评估-总结-更新）自动发现、组合并适应隐写策略，同时配套PC-DNTE算法以在高嵌入率下保持与基模型条件分布的一致性，实现高隐蔽性与安全性。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of LLMs, high quality generative text has become
widely available as a cover for text steganography. However, prevailing methods
rely on hand-crafted or pre-specified strategies and struggle to balance
efficiency, imperceptibility, and security, particularly at high embedding
rates. Accordingly, we propose Auto-Stega, an agent-driven self-evolving
framework that is the first to realize self-evolving steganographic strategies
by automatically discovering, composing, and adapting strategies at inference
time; the framework operates as a closed loop of generating, evaluating,
summarizing, and updating that continually curates a structured strategy
library and adapts across corpora, styles, and task constraints. A decoding LLM
recovers the information under the shared strategy. To handle high embedding
rates, we introduce PC-DNTE, a plug-and-play algorithm that maintains alignment
with the base model's conditional distribution at high embedding rates,
preserving imperceptibility while enhancing security. Experimental results
demonstrate that at higher embedding rates Auto-Stega achieves superior
performance with gains of 42.2\% in perplexity and 1.6\% in anti-steganalysis
performance over SOTA methods.

### [9] [Reading Between the Lines: Towards Reliable Black-box LLM Fingerprinting via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06605)
*Shuo Shao,Yiming Li,Hongwei Yao,Yifei Chen,Yuchen Yang,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZeroPrint在黑盒设置下用语义保持的词替换和零阶梯度估计，得到近似Jacobian指纹，较传统输出基方法更具区分性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为昂贵知识产权的版权保护问题，现有黑盒指纹方法效果差，需更有效识别模型来源

Method: 基于Fisher信息理论推导输入梯度优于输出；用语义保持的替换产生扰动样本，采样模型输出并用零阶方法估计输入梯度/Jacobian，构建指纹并与源模型指纹比对以鉴别模型

Result: 提出ZeroPrint，通过基于Fisher信息论证明输入梯度比输出信息量更大，并在黑盒下用零阶估计与语义不变词替换近似估计模型的Jacobian，实验表明在基准上效果和鲁棒性均优于现有黑盒方法

Conclusion: 输入梯度（模型对输入的敏感性）比输出更能作为指纹信息；ZeroPrint通过语义替换实现离散文本上的零阶Jacobian估计，显著提升黑盒指纹效果

Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs)
makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about
copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to
address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic,
unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model
to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods
often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness
arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose
critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of
non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information
Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more
informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight,
we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich
gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint
overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input
perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows
ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint.
Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a
state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming
existing black-box methods.

### [10] [Code Agent can be an End-to-end System Hacker: Benchmarking Real-world Threats of Computer-use Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06607)
*Weidi Luo,Qiming Zhang,Tianyu Lu,Xiaogeng Liu,Bin Hu,Hung-Chun Chiu,Siyuan Ma,Yizhe Zhang,Xusheng Xiao,Yinzhi Cao,Zhen Xiang,Chaowei Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出AdvCUA，一个基于MITRE ATT&CK的CUA安全评估基准，包含140个任务（40条直接恶意、74条基于TTP、26条端到端攻击链），在多主机沙箱内通过硬编码评估五类主流CUA（ReAct、AutoGPT、Gemini CLI、Cursor CLI、Cursor IDE）与8种基础模型的表现，发现当前CUA在OS安全威胁覆盖不足，可能降低攻击门槛并被滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CUA（尤其基于LLM/MLLM）在操作系统控制领域的快速发展，研究其在真实企业环境中是否会被滥用于实施安全相关攻击变得紧迫，现有评估工作在攻击模型、场景现实性与端到端覆盖上存在明显不足。

Method: 构建与MITRE ATT&CK对齐的140项任务基准（含直接恶意任务、TTP驱动任务与完整攻击链），在真实感多主机企业OS沙箱中对五个主流CUA和8个基础LLM进行硬编码评估，避免LLM作为裁判并使用多主机与加密凭证以提高现实性。

Result: 在140项任务评估中，五类CUA对OS安全威胁的覆盖能力普遍不足，但展示出足以降低攻击门槛的能力，使得缺乏深度专业知识的攻击者也可借助CUA执行复杂入侵。

Conclusion: AdvCUA展示了现有CUA在操作系统安全相关场景中的显著不足，现有工具和模型易被滥用以完成复杂企业入侵，强调需要加强CUA的安全设计、访问控制和责任机制。

Abstract: Computer-use agent (CUA) frameworks, powered by large language models (LLMs)
or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), are rapidly maturing as assistants that can
perceive context, reason, and act directly within software environments. Among
their most critical applications is operating system (OS) control. As CUAs in
the OS domain become increasingly embedded in daily operations, it is
imperative to examine their real-world security implications, specifically
whether CUAs can be misused to perform realistic, security-relevant attacks.
Existing works exhibit four major limitations: Missing attacker-knowledge model
on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), Incomplete coverage for
end-to-end kill chains, unrealistic environment without multi-host and
encrypted user credentials, and unreliable judgment dependent on
LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these gaps, we propose AdvCUA, the first benchmark
aligned with real-world TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, which comprises
140 tasks, including 40 direct malicious tasks, 74 TTP-based malicious tasks,
and 26 end-to-end kill chains, systematically evaluates CUAs under a realistic
enterprise OS security threat in a multi-host environment sandbox by hard-coded
evaluation. We evaluate the existing five mainstream CUAs, including ReAct,
AutoGPT, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, and Cursor IDE based on 8 foundation LLMs. The
results demonstrate that current frontier CUAs do not adequately cover OS
security-centric threats. These capabilities of CUAs reduce dependence on
custom malware and deep domain expertise, enabling even inexperienced attackers
to mount complex enterprise intrusions, which raises social concern about the
responsibility and security of CUAs.

### [11] [Unsupervised Backdoor Detection and Mitigation for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06629)
*Jiachen Li,Bang Wu,Xiaoyu Xia,Xiaoning Liu,Xun Yi,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 针对SNN后门威胁，提出基于时间膜电位的无监督检测TMPBD与基于树突抑制的缓解NDSBM，实验显示检测率100%，缓解后攻击成功率显著下降且不损失干净精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在能效上优于ANN，但其事件驱动与时间相关性导致传统ANN后门防御效果差或易被绕过；因此需要专门针对SNN特性的无监督检测与稳健缓解方法。

Method: 提出TMPBD：基于最终脉冲层的时间膜电位（TMP）最大边缘统计量进行目标标签检测，无需攻击信息或数据；提出NDSBM：利用来自小量干净无标签数据的TMP引导，在早期卷积层对树突连接进行clamp限制以抑制恶意神经元，从而实现后门缓解。

Result: 在多种神经形态基准和最新的输入感知动态触发攻击上，TMPBD检测准确率达100%；NDSBM将攻击成功率从100%降至8.44%，与检测结合后降至2.81%，且不降低干净样本准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的TMPBD能在无标签数据下仅凭最终膜电位时序统计检测后门目标标签，并结合NDSBM在树突连接上进行约束以抑制恶意神经元，从而在不损害干净样本精度下显著降低后门攻击成功率。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their
superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have
received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform
poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal
dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional
backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection
framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome
these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal
membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels
without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust
mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM),
which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to
suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP
extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic
trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while
NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when
combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

*Zhiyuan Wei,Xiaoxuan Yang,Jing Sun,Zijian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FineSec用知识蒸馏把大模型能力迁移到小模型，构建了完整流水线，在C/C++漏洞检测上既准确又高效，适合现实部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件复杂性导致安全漏洞频发，现有方法在精确性或效率上存在权衡；LLM在语言任务上表现优越，但直接在代码漏洞检测上应用成本高且未充分探索，故提出基于知识蒸馏的实用方案。

Method: FineSec构建了一套从数据准备、模型蒸馏训练、评估到持续学习的单任务流水线。采用大规模教师模型生成软标签或解释性知识，训练体积更小的学生模型以复现教师表现，同时优化训练细节以适配C/C++代码特征。

Result: 在多套C/C++数据集上的广泛评估表明，FineSec优于基线模型及部分更大的LLM，尤其在复杂漏洞与逻辑缺陷的识别上表现更好，同时显著降低计算资源需求。相关数据集、代码与实验结果已开源以便复现。

Conclusion: FineSec通过将大模型的知识蒸馏到小型学生模型，实现了在C/C++漏洞检测任务上高效且精确的识别，兼顾性能与计算成本，适合实际部署。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems exacerbates the
prevalence of security vulnerabilities, posing risks of severe breaches and
substantial economic loss. Consequently, robust code vulnerability detection is
essential for software security. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their
potential for automated code vulnerability detection remains underexplored.
This paper presents FineSec, a novel framework that harnesses LLMs through
knowledge distillation to enable efficient and precise vulnerability
identification in C/C++ codebases. FineSec utilizes knowledge distillation to
transfer expertise from large teacher models to compact student models,
achieving high accuracy with minimal computational cost. By integrating data
preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a unified,
single-task workflow, FineSec offers a streamlined approach. Extensive
evaluations on C/C++ codebases demonstrate its superiority over both base
models and larger LLMs in identifying complex vulnerabilities and logical
flaws, establishing FineSec as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
software security. To facilitate reproducibility, the datasets, source code,

### [13] [Differentially Private Synthetic Text Generation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06719)
*Junki Mori,Kazuya Kakizaki,Taiki Miyagawa,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出DP-SynRAG，用LLM生成差分隐私(DP)合成RAG数据库，合成数据可重用避免查询时重复加噪，从而固定隐私预算下提升私有RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有私有RAG方法在查询时需重复注入噪声导致隐私损失累积的问题，寻找在固定隐私预算下仍能保持高下游任务性能的可扩展方案。

Method: 利用LLM进行私有合成：对原始数据库进行子采样，并通过指令引导LLM生成模仿这些子样本的文本；在生成过程中应用差分隐私保护（如私有预测机制）以控制隐私损失。生成的合成RAG数据库可被反复使用，避免对每次查询重复注入噪声。

Result: 在实验中，DP-SynRAG在相同隐私预算下优于最先进的私有RAG系统，证明通过合成数据库并一次性支付隐私成本能够获得更好性能与可扩展性。

Conclusion: DP-SynRAG通过基于私有预测的合成文本生成策略，在固定隐私预算下，比现有的基于查询时间DP方法表现更好，提供可扩展的隐私保护RAG方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive
domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically
rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise
injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we
propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially
private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can
be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and
additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG
tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate
text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show
that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private
RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable
solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Bionetta, an UltraGroth-based ZK ML framework, achieves much faster proving for custom neural nets (even on mobile), pays higher preprocessing costs, and is uniquely EVM-deployable with low proof size/verification overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a zero-knowledge ML framework that enables proving on resource-constrained devices and deployable on native EVM with small proof size and verification costs.

Method: Use UltraGroth SNARKs with custom-crafted neural network circuits and optimizations to reduce proving complexity; accept higher compilation and trusted setup costs to get small proofs and low verification overhead suitable for EVM.

Result: Significant speedup in proving time for custom-crafted neural networks, enabling mobile-device proving; higher one-time preprocessing costs; deployable on EVM with manageable proof size and verification overheads.

Conclusion: Bionetta enables client-side proving by dramatically reducing proving time for tailored networks and is suitable for native EVM deployment, though preprocessing and trusted setup are more expensive.

Abstract: In this report, we compare the performance of our UltraGroth-based
zero-knowledge machine learning framework Bionetta to other tools of similar
purpose such as EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, or zkml. The results show a
significant boost in the proving time for custom-crafted neural networks: they
can be proven even on mobile devices, enabling numerous client-side proving
applications. While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing
steps, such as circuit compilation and generating trusted setup, our approach
is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native
EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

### [15] [Exposing Citation Vulnerabilities in Generative Engines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06823)
*Riku Mochizuki,Shusuke Komatsu,Souta Noguchi,Kazuto Ataka*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Study assesses GE citation sources to evaluate risk of web-poisoning; U.S. political answers more exposed than Japan; many low-barrier sources cited but not well reflected; recommends ways for primary sources to increase exposure though language limits apply.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how generative engines (GEs) selecting web citations affect vulnerability to poisoning attacks and define measures to assess and mitigate such threats.

Method: Define criteria classifying publisher attributes; analyze citations in political-domain GE answers for Japan and U.S.; measure proportion of primary-source citations and assess reflection of cited content in answers.

Result: Introduced evaluation criteria classifying publisher attributes to estimate content-injection barrier; found varying proportions of citations from primary sources (25-45% U.S., 60-65% Japan); identified frequent citation of low-barrier sources that are poorly reflected in answers; discussed mitigation and limitations due to language differences.

Conclusion: GEs are vulnerable to poisoning due to inclusion of low-barrier web sources; improving exposure of primary publishers can help, but language constraints limit effectiveness of standard techniques.

Abstract: We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the
perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined
as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by
placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search
and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because
anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning
attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer
content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be
selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we
introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation
information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher
attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby
revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct
experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using
our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary
sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and
\(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at
higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low
content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in
answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary
sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that
well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 对KEVC条目分析显示对OT相关漏洞提供替代缓解的比例低（13%），提出基于漏洞/利用特性设计替代修复的可行方法并给出初步成功案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估公开漏洞信息（KEVC）是否足以支持OT环境的有效修复决策。

Method: 系统性审查KEVC条目（截至2025年7月），标注OT相关性、是否含厂商缓解/绕过措施；进一步分析漏洞与利用特性以评估开发替代措施的可行性，并实现若干早期替代缓解实例。

Result: 分析截至2025年7月的所有KEVC条目，发现多数可影响OT，但仅13%提供厂商绕过或缓解措施；并通过漏洞/利用特性研究，展示开发替代修复措施的可行性和早期成功证据。

Conclusion: 现有KEVC数据对OT环境的修复支持不足，应补充和推广基于漏洞/利用特征的缓解措施；可行且已在早期验证。

Abstract: We examine the state of publicly available information about known
exploitable vulnerabilities applicable to operational technology (OT)
environments. Specifically, we analyze the Known Exploitable Vulnerabilities
Catalog (KEVC) maintained by the US Department of Homeland Security
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to assess whether
currently available data is sufficient for effective and reliable remediation
in OT settings. Our team analyzed all KEVC entries through July 2025 to
determine the extent to which OT environments can rely on existing remediation
recommendations. We found that although most entries in the KEVC could affect
OT environments, only 13% include vendor workarounds or mitigations as
alternatives to patching. This paper also examines the feasibility of
developing such alternatives based on vulnerability and exploit
characteristics, and we present early evidence of success with this approach.

*Muris Sladić,Veronica Valeros,Carlos Catania,Sebastian Garcia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出VelLMes，一个基于大模型的网络欺骗框架，能模拟多种协议（如SSH shell、MySQL、POP3、HTTP），并可作为蜜罐部署。通过单元测试与89名人类攻击者的交互评估，部分LLM在生成真实响应上表现优异，约30%攻击者将LLM蜜罐误判为真实系统；另外在互联网部署的10个SSH实例也显示LLM蜜罐能正确应对大多数非结构化攻击命令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的欺骗系统稀少且多局限于单一服务（主要SSH），且缺乏包含人类攻击者的充分评估；随着生成式AI在安全领域的兴起，研究如何用LLM构建更真实、多样化的蜜罐具有重要价值。

Method: 设计并实现多协议（SSH、MySQL、POP3、HTTP）LLM驱动蜜罐框架；通过对LLM的单元测试检查生成质量；用89名人类攻击者参与的实地交互测试SSH欺骗效果；在互联网上部署10个SSH实例收集真实攻击并分析响应正确率。

Result: 单元测试表明部分LLM在生成响应上可达100%通过率；在人类攻击者测试中，约30%受试者将LLM蜜罐误认为真实系统；在互联网上部署的10个SSH蜜罐能正确响应大多数非结构化攻击命令，显示实用性。

Conclusion: VelLMes证明：经过精心提示工程，LLM能生成高度真实的服务响应，能用于多协议蜜罐，并在与人类攻击者交互和实网攻击捕获中展现出有效的欺骗能力，但仍非对所有攻击完全稳健。

Abstract: There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The
existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH
shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -
lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has
recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and
practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers
have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking
honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as
honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,
which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,
MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus
VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'
needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and
realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities
and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using
unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful
prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having
a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception
capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the
attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were
assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH
Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of
these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform
well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding
correctly to most of the issued commands.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出RedTWIZ，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在AI辅助软件开发场景中鲁棒性的多轮对抗框架。RedTWIZ集成了对话逃避（jailbreak）系统化评估、多样化生成式多轮攻击套件和层级式攻击规划器，能够自适应地策划并触发针对特定模型弱点的复杂攻击。实验证明其多轮攻击能使最先进LLMs产生不安全输出，表明需要更多研究提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在对话场景下可能被多轮交互诱导绕过安全限制（jailbreak），现有评估方法不足以覆盖组合性与策略性的攻击；因此需要一个能产生多样化、目标驱动且能自适应规划的多轮攻击框架来全面审计模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了三大技术组成：1）对话型jailbreak的系统化评估方法；2）多样化的生成式多轮攻击套件，支持组合式、现实化和目标导向的攻击策略；3）层级式攻击规划器，可自适应地为特定模型规划、序列化并触发攻击。框架结合评估、攻击生成与策略规划，进行大规模实验评估。

Result: 大量实验表明RedTWIZ的多轮对抗策略能有效导致最先进LLMs输出不安全内容，系统与各组件在揭示模型脆弱性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: RedTWIZ通过整合评估、攻击生成与策略规划，成功暴露了多种LLM在多轮对话中的安全弱点；其实验结果表明该框架能有效诱使先进模型生成不安全内容，强调了对抗性多轮测试在模型安全性评估中的必要性。

Abstract: This paper presents the vision, scientific contributions, and technical
details of RedTWIZ: an adaptive and diverse multi-turn red teaming framework,
to audit the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-assisted software
development. Our work is driven by three major research streams: (1) robust and
systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks; (2) a diverse
generative multi-turn attack suite, supporting compositional, realistic and
goal-oriented jailbreak conversational strategies; and (3) a hierarchical
attack planner, which adaptively plans, serializes, and triggers attacks
tailored to specific LLM's vulnerabilities. Together, these contributions form
a unified framework -- combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic
planning -- to comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs'
robustness. Extensive evaluation is conducted to systematically assess and
analyze the performance of the overall system and each component. Experimental
results demonstrate that our multi-turn adversarial attack strategies can
successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations,
highlighting the pressing need for more research into enhancing LLM's
robustness.

Motivation: Address computational challenges of solving MDPs for problems motivated by Last Revealer Attack (LRA) in PoS blockchains like Ethereum.

Method: 定义pMDP模型并提出两种归约到标准MDP的方法，结合两者优化值迭代等动态规划，理论复杂度分析并通过两个案例验证。

Result: Introduces pseudo-MDPs (pMDPs) and two reductions to standard MDPs, combining them reduces complexity from exponential to O(kappa^4) per iteration and enables fast convergence and simpler policy extraction; validated on card game and Ethereum LRA.

Conclusion: pMDPs及双重归约显著降低计算复杂度、加快动态规划收敛并简化策略提取，可推广到更广泛的MDP类问题，对区块链安全分析有实用价值。

Abstract: This study tackles the computational challenges of solving Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) for a restricted class of problems. It is motivated by the
Last Revealer Attack (LRA), which undermines fairness in some Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum (\$400B market capitalization). We introduce
pseudo-MDPs (pMDPs) a framework that naturally models such problems and propose
two distinct problem reductions to standard MDPs. One problem reduction
provides a novel, counter-intuitive perspective, and combining the two problem
reductions enables significant improvements in dynamic programming algorithms
such as value iteration. In the case of the LRA which size is parameterized by
$\kappa$ (in Ethereum's case $\kappa$= 325), we reduce the computational
complexity from $O(2^\kappa \kappa^{2^{\kappa+2}})$ to $O(\kappa^4)$ (per
iteration). This solution also provide the usual benefits from Dynamic
Programming solutions: exponentially fast convergence toward the optimal
solution is guaranteed. The dual perspective also simplifies policy extraction,
making the approach well-suited for resource-constrained agents who can operate
with very limited memory and computation once the problem has been solved.
Furthermore, we generalize those results to a broader class of MDPs, enhancing
their applicability. The framework is validated through two case studies: a
fictional card game and the LRA on the Ethereum random seed consensus protocol.
These applications demonstrate the framework's ability to solve large-scale
problems effectively while offering actionable insights into optimal
strategies. This work advances the study of MDPs and contributes to
understanding security vulnerabilities in blockchain systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出在可编程逻辑控制器(PLC)内部运行的嵌入式入侵检测系统，利用报头级别的网络遥测数据，结合半监督异常检测与监督攻击分类来检测并响应工业控制系统中的网络攻击。在中游油罐装载测试平台上评估，异常检测器实现零漏报（Matthews相关系数0.998），分类器在保留集和外部数据集上分别达到97.37%和97.03%的准确率。嵌入式实现对端到端延迟的中位增加为2031微秒，不影响PLC周期时间，满足实时性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多PLC缺少分层防御，一旦受信任终端（如HMI）被攻陷，攻击者可下发危及安全的执行命令，因此需在控制器内部部署检测与响应机制以降低风险并满足实时性约束。

Method: 系统在PLC内部采集报头级别网络遥测，首先使用半监督异常检测器识别偏离正常网络行为的流量（确保低漏报），随后用监督分类器对检测到的异常进行具体攻击类型分类。评估包含三个在油罐装载场景采集的数据集，并测量检测性能与系统引入的延迟。

Result: 异常检测实现零漏报，Matthews相关系数0.998；分类器保留集准确率97.37%，外部数据集准确率97.03%。嵌入式实现对端到端延迟中位增加2031微秒，不影响PLC周期时间。

Conclusion: 在PLC内部部署的多层嵌入式检测架构能在不影响实时控制周期的前提下，准确检测并分类网络攻击，适用于安全关键的工业控制环境。

Abstract: Industrial control system (ICS) operations use trusted endpoints like human
machine interfaces (HMIs) and workstations to relay commands to programmable
logic controllers (PLCs). Because most PLCs lack layered defenses, compromise
of a trusted endpoint can drive unsafe actuator commands and risk
safety-critical operation. This research presents an embedded intrusion
detection system that runs inside the controller and uses header-level
telemetry to detect and respond to network attacks. The system combines a
semi-supervised anomaly detector and a supervised attack classifier. We
evaluate the approach on a midstream oil-terminal testbed using three datasets
collected during tanker-truck loading. The anomaly detector achieves zero
missed attacks, corresponding to 0.998 Matthews correlation. The supervised
stage attains 97.37 percent hold-out accuracy and 97.03 percent external
accuracy. The embedded design adds a median of 2,031 microseconds of end-to-end
latency and does not impact PLC's cycle time. The proposed architecture
provides a multi-layer embedded security that meets the real-time requirements
of an industrial system.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLM代理的互动和工具调用会在加密网络流量中产生可识别指纹，攻击者可据此识别代理并推断用户敏感属性；提出的AgentPrint展示了高效的攻击效果，呼吁采取技术与治理对策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理因其交互性和可扩展工具集成被广泛部署，但这些交互可能在流量层面暴露敏感信息，研究旨在评估并量化这种被忽视的风险。

Method: 通过收集和分析代理工作流与工具调用对应的加密流量模式，构建了称为AgentPrint的攻击模型，使用特征提取与分类器来识别代理类型并推断用户属性。

Result: AgentPrint在代理识别上F1=0.866；在用户属性推断上，模拟用户场景top-3准确率73.9%，真实用户场景69.1%，表明流量指纹具有实用的推断能力。

Conclusion: 本论文揭示了LLM代理在与用户交互并调用外部工具时，会在加密流量中留下可被识别的模式，从而导致隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that
orchestrate tasks and integrate external tools to execute complex workflows. We
demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in
encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic
patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can
infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive
user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves
an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3
accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings,
respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity
that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent
need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.

Motivation: 降低生成隐写中对精确高斯先验映射的计算开销，并提供统一分析工具比较像素空间与潜在空间架构

Method: Approx Gaussian mapping + capacity-aware adaptive optimization

Result: 提出尺度因子校准的近似高斯映射框架；发现像素模型在对抗检测上更安全但对通道扰动脆弱，VAE潜在空间模型稳健但易被检测；识别VAE的编码器增强稳健性、解码器放大扰动导致脆弱性

Conclusion: 架构中编码器与解码器对隐写的安全性与稳健性有相反作用，为后续设计提供理论与实践指引。

Abstract: Current generative steganography research mainly pursues computationally
expensive mappings to perfect Gaussian priors within single diffusion model
architectures. This work introduces an efficient framework based on approximate
Gaussian mapping governed by a scale factor calibrated through capacity-aware
adaptive optimization. Using this framework as a unified analytical tool,
systematic comparative analysis of steganography in pixel-space models versus
VAE-based latent-space systems is conducted. The investigation reveals a
pronounced architecture dependent security-robustness trade-off: pixel-space
models achieve high security against steganalysis but exhibit fragility to
channel distortions, while VAE-based systems like Stable Diffusion offer
substantial robustness at the cost of security vulnerabilities. Further
analysis indicates that the VAE component drives this behavior through opposing
mechanisms where the encoder confers robustness via manifold regularization
while the decoder introduces vulnerabilities by amplifying latent perturbations
into detectable artifacts. These findings characterize the conflicting
architectural roles in generative steganography and establish a foundation for
future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出用图结构学习优化拓扑与节点表示来增强IoE网络对抗性攻击的防护，实验表明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoE将物联网与电力系统深度融合，带来更复杂的攻击面和更高的公共安全风险，需在网络层设计可抵抗对抗性操纵的防护机制。

Method: 提出一个联合优化框架，结合图结构重构与节点表征学习，在训练过程中同时调整邻接矩阵和节点嵌入以减轻对抗性扰动的影响；通过在安全数据集上与代表性基线（如传统图神经网络、对抗训练方法）对比验证性能提升。

Result: 提出了一种基于图结构学习（GSL）的网络层防护框架，通过联合优化图拓扑和节点表示来提升物联网能源（IoE）网络对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性。论文通过概念性概述、架构讨论及安全数据集上的案例研究，证明GSL在鲁棒性上优于代表性方法，并指出了未来研究方向及挑战。

Conclusion: GSL能显著提高IoE网络在面对对抗性网络模型操纵时的鲁棒性，适合作为网络层防护方案，但仍需解决可扩展性、实时性和跨域适应等挑战。

Abstract: The Internet of Energy (IoE) integrates IoT-driven digital communication with
power grids to enable efficient and sustainable energy systems. Still, its
interconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber
threats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional
safeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety
consequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level
safeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based
safeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node
representations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently.
Through a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a
security dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative
methods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against
evolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the
resilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing
critical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose
future research directions in this novel research area.

Motivation: 解决基础模型内在推理能力受限与测试时迭代不可靠的问题，通过引入精确计算和外部检索使推理更可验证、更可迭代。

Method: 系统集成两类工具：Python计算（含数值与符号库）与检索工具；采用共享状态图记录候选解、可执行检查与反馈，支持多轮、多模型的解答演化与验证；在AIME数据上对不同模型进行了评估。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025评测中，针对Qwen2.5-14B和Llama-3.3-70B分别带来Average@32和Pass@32的显著提升；工具调用成功率超过80%，整体表现优于不使用工具的基线。

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,

further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出以解的最小复杂度超出训练分布为推理泛化判据（Complexity OoD）；用柯氏复杂度与代理指标量化；并给出在基准、监督与模型设计上操作化的建议，指出需超越仅靠数据扩展的技术路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏明确的推理能力定义与评估，需一个可操作且理论结合的框架来衡量模型在高解复杂度场景下的泛化能力，从而推动面向System2风格推理的研究与模型改进。

Method: 形式化最小解的柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂度和操作性代理（如对象/关系计数、推理步数），并通过定义Complexity OoD来构造测试集；提出在评估、监督和模型设计中引入复杂度相关指标和训练策略。

Result: 提出了Complexity OoD作为推理能力的定义与评估框架，强调最小解复杂度超出训练分布时模型需保持性能；用柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂度及操作代理指标形式化复杂度，区分长度和组合性OoD；提出将该框架应用于基准、监督、模型设计以促进面向复杂度的泛化，并指出仅扩数据不足以解决问题，需要显式建模与分配计算资源的架构与训练方法。

Conclusion: 复杂度域外泛化是衡量与推动推理能力的适切框架，要求在基准、监督和模型架构上引入复杂度意识，并发展显式计算分配与步骤级监督以避免投机性捷径；仅靠规模化数据无法解决。

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

TL;DR: BuilderBench 提供硬件加速的机器人方块模拟器和包含42+目标结构的任务集，强调无监督探索学习与长程规划，且附带单目标“训练轮辅助”协议与六种算法参考实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI主要靠模仿与强化，难以解决超出数据分布的新颖问题，因而需发展可扩展的交互式探索学习机制，培养通过经验获取技能的智能体。

Method: 构建物理模拟环境与多样化目标结构任务集，设置无监督训练阶段（自由探索）与评估阶段（构建未见目标），并提供训练轮辅助协议与六种参考算法的单文件实现。

Result: 该论文提出了BuilderBench，一个围绕开放式探索的智能体预训练基准，目标是让智能体通过交互学习搭建任意结构。

Conclusion: 当前算法难以完成多数任务，表明需要更强的探索与具身推理能力；BuilderBench 为此提供评测平台与起点实现，有助推动相关研究。

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

TL;DR: BCCS通过为每个智能体选择最优协作者并用系统内部信念校准共识判断，解决传统投票式共识忽视内部矛盾和盲目交互的问题，在MATH与MMLU上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体共识方法依赖投票判断共识，忽视系统内部信念矛盾且与所有智能体盲目交互，导致共识不稳定；因此需要选择最优协作者并利用内部信念校准共识判断以提高稳定性。

Method: BCCS (Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking)

Result: 提出理论框架选择最优协作者以最大化共识稳定性，并基于此构建BCCS框架，通过选择协作者和基于系统内部信念校准共识判断实现稳定共识；在MATH和MMLU数据集上分别提升约2.23%和3.95%的准确率。

Conclusion: BCCS理论与方法能提升多智能体系统的共识稳定性与任务性能，表明选择性协作与内部信念校准是改进MAS共识机制的有效策略。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at

*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有单独训练的推理型大模型在处理偏离推理轨迹（被误导或接受指导）方面表现差；更强模型更易受干扰，且蒸馏会传递教师的缺陷，协作解决率低于9.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使多个推理模型在共享轨迹中协作需要模型能评估和基于他人部分思路继续推理（离轨推理）；但现有solo训练是否能达到这一点尚不清楚，因此需检验并指导未来训练方法。

Method: 提出Recoverability与Guidability两个测试，构造误导性及指导性推理轨迹，评估15个开源模型在两类任务上的表现，并做控制实验改变蒸馏教师、使用RL和不同数据选择以分析这些因素影响。

Result: The paper empirically studies whether existing reasoning LLMs (trained solo) can handle off-trajectory reasoning: recover from misleading traces and leverage guidance from stronger models. It evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B–32B) using twin tests Recoverability and Guidability, finds stronger models more fragile to distraction, and that all models poorly leverage collaborators (solve rates <9.2%). Control studies show distillation transfers teachers' suboptimal recoverability and analyze effects of RL and data selection, giving training insights.

Conclusion: 标准的独立推理训练难以赋予模型有效的离轨推理能力；需要专门的训练策略（注意教师选择、RL与数据筛选）来培养可恢复且可指导的协作推理模型。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

Method: 收集USDA数据库中食物类黄酮含量和文献中癌症相关信息，应用KNARM方法论对实体和关系进行建模并生成机器可操作的知识图谱。

Result: 构建了一个以USDA类黄酮数据与文献中癌症关联为核心的知识图谱，使用KNARM方法论将关系表示为机器可操作格式，为研究者探索饮食与疾病管理间复杂关系提供示例。

Conclusion: 提出的知识图谱为研究者提供了一个起点，展示如何以语义网形式表示食物与健康间的关系；未来需扩展数据范围、捕捉更多细微差异并实现推理以发现潜在关联。

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

*Jiahe Jin,Abhijay Paladugu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过在训练数据中注入四种关键推理行为（信息验证、权威评估、自适应搜索、错误恢复），并以此进行SFT再结合RL，显著提升了LLM在agentic search任务中的表现；关键在于推理行为质量而非最终答案正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: agentic search对LLM提出新的多步骤规划、检索与综合信息的能力要求，现有训练方式难以培养有效的推理与代理行为，亟需通过行为级别的干预提升模型在检索与交互环境中的表现。

Method: 构建基于LLM的推理驱动管线，分析成功agentic搜索轨迹以提取四种有益行为；用这些行为合成训练轨迹并对模型进行监督微调，再用常规强化学习优化；评估在GAIA、WebWalker、HLE三项基准上。

Result: The paper proposes a reasoning-driven pipeline and Behavior Priming to enhance LLM-based agentic search by incorporating four beneficial behaviors identified from successful trajectories, improving performance after SFT+RL.

Conclusion: Behavior Priming通过合成含有目标推理行为的轨迹并用于SFT（随后RL），可以显著提升agentic search模型的探索能力和测试时扩展性，从而在多个基准上取得大幅性能提升；训练数据中是否含有期望的推理行为比答案正确性更关键。

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: 提出 APE 框架：自动从失败案例学习辅助评估维度，使用 Collective Confidence 的置信度集成机制，有选择地采用额外维度，从而在多项基准上提升 LLM 评判器与人类/更可靠评判的契合度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 LLM 评判器常漏掉重要评估维度，因为模型难以识别隐含的人类评分标准。需要一种能在测试时动态弥补缺失维度并提升评判可靠性的机制。

Method: APE 包括两个关键模块：1) 从失败案例自动生成并学习额外评估维度（Auto-Prompt），不断扩充和更新评估维度集合；2) 基于 Collective Confidence 的置信度估计与集成策略，在推断时对主判断与辅助维度判断进行加权或选择性采纳。

Result: 提出了一种名为 Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) 的框架，通过在失败案例中自动学习评估维度并有选择地引入辅助维度来提高大模型（LLM）评判器的可靠性。APE 使用一种称为 Collective Confidence 的新的置信度估计方法，通过基于置信度的集成机制决定何时采用额外维度的判断。在标准基准上实验证明 APE 提升了 LLM 判断一致性，例如在零样本设置下将 GPT-4o 在 Reward Bench 的一致率从87.2%提高到90.5%。

Conclusion: APE 能有效缓解 LLM 评判器忽视隐含人类评估标准的问题，通过自适应学习附加评估维度并基于置信度决定采纳，显著提升评判一致性与可靠性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

TL;DR: WebDART splits web tasks into navigation, extraction, execution and replans dynamically, improving success and efficiency on complex web benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paper aims to make single LLM handle complex web tasks requiring long-horizon navigation, large-scale info extraction, reasoning under constraints.

Method: Decompose each objective into three focused subtasks and continuously replan decomposition using newly discovered page info; LLM focuses on one skill at a time and avoids redundant exploration.

Result: WebDART dynamically decomposes objectives into navigation, extraction, execution subtasks and replans as new pages revealed; improves success rates up to 13.7 pp and reduces navigation steps up to 14.7 on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic decomposition and replanning allow a single LLM to better handle complex web chores, achieving SOTA gains on WebChoreArena and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

Motivation: 现有基于ICL的方法侧重于推理过程，通过语义相似示例改善表示，但忽视了决策阶段。语义相似示例可能在情绪上不一致，破坏情绪原型匹配，导致错误。

Method: 提出Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL)：1) 在上下文中选入情绪相似而非仅语义相似的示例；2) 使用动态软标签调整示例对查询表征的影响；3) 采用两阶段排除策略从多角度评估相似性，优化最终决策。

Result: 大量实验在多个数据集上表明EICL在准确率和鲁棒性上显著优于传统ICL，证明情绪相似示例和两阶段排除策略能有效提升情绪表征与决策。

Conclusion: 本文提出EICL，通过引入情绪相似示例、动态软标签和两阶段排除策略，提升细粒度情绪识别的决策过程，显著优于传统ICL。

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: Introduce AITL that collects four live annotation types (response preferences, agent adoption/rationales, knowledge relevance, missing knowledge) to create a continuous data flywheel, enabling faster model updates and measurable gains in retrieval, generation, and adoption in production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce long retraining cycles and improve LLM-based customer support by embedding human feedback directly into live operations rather than relying on slow offline batch annotations.

Method: Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) continuous data flywheel with live annotations

Result: Production pilot showed retrieval accuracy +11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8; generation quality +8.4% helpfulness; agent adoption +4.5%.

Conclusion: Embedding diverse, operational human feedback into live workflows yields faster, scalable model improvements and better support outcomes compared to traditional offline annotation pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

Motivation: 当前研究尝试自动化设计代理系统以提高效率和性能，但缺乏对元代理在学习机制、产出代理多样性及经济可行性的系统性评估。作者旨在揭示这些关键瓶颈并提出改进方向。

Method: 作者通过对比实验研究元代理的训练与测试流程：比较将所有历史代理加入上下文与忽略历史的策略，提出并评估一种演化（evolutionary）方法来改进跨代学习；分析设计出的多代理在行为空间的多样性；进行成本效益分析，计算设计+部署成本与人工设计在不同部署规模和数据集上的对比。

Result: 实验结果表明：1）将所有历史代理加入上下文的做法表现较差，演化方法能提升性能；2）自动化设计产生的代理群体行为多样性低，限制了协同或组合带来的增益；3）仅在少数（两）数据集且部署规模大（>15,000示例）时，自动设计才在成本上优于人工设计，其余情况成本高于收益。

Conclusion: 本文指出现有元代理在迭代学习、测试时只选单一设计、以及经济可行性三方面存在显著问题：简单将历史代理全部加入上下文反而比忽略历史更差；演化方法可改善跨代学习；自动设计产出的代理行为多样性低，限制组合使用潜力；只有极少数数据集在大规模部署时才能抵消设计成本。

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出MultiCNKG，将认知神经科学知识图、基因本体和疾病本体融合，通过LLM进行实体对齐与语义扩展，构建包含6.9K节点与11.3K边的多层次知识图用于连接基因、疾病与认知功能，评估显示高精度与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉基因、疾病與认知过程间复杂语义联系，LLM在语义理解与跨本体对齐方面提供新机会，旨在构建一个连通分子到行为领域的综合知识图。

Method: 利用GPT-4等大语言模型执行实体对齐、语义相似度计算与图扩充；将CNKG、GO、DO合并并消歧，生成统一节点类型与关系类型；使用TransE、RotatE评估链路预测表现，并通过专家验证与一致性、覆盖率等指标定量评估。

Result: 构建了含6.9K节点与11.3K边的MultiCNKG，精度85.20%、召回87.30%、覆盖92.18%、图一致性82.50%，专家验证89.50%，并在TransE与RotatE链路预测任务上取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: MultiCNKG成功整合多源本体与知识图，通过LLM驱动的对齐与扩展提高了覆盖率与一致性，能支持个性化医疗、认知障碍诊断与科学假设生成。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出用于对LLM策略在无记忆序贯决策任务中进行自动化形式验证的工具：基于LLM引导增量构建可达MDP并用Storm检查PCTL安全性；能与Ollama/PRISM集成，实验在网格世界上显示可验证但性能低于强化学习基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化、严格地验证基于大型语言模型（LLM）的策略在记忆无关的序贯决策任务中的安全性与正确性。

Method: 增量性可达集构建：将MDP状态转为自然语言提示，调用LLM（通过Ollama），解析输出为动作，扩展后继状态；使用Storm对构建的模型进行PCTL检测；支持PRISM规范并在网格世界基准上实验。

Result: 提出了一种工具：增量构建由LLM策略可达的MDP部分，将每个状态编码为自然语言提示，解析LLM响应为动作并扩展后继状态，然后使用Storm对得到的形式模型进行PCTL安全性检验。实验表明：在标准网格世界基准上，使用Ollama以确定性随机数种子时可验证开源LLM，但其表现通常不如深度强化学习基线。工具原生支持Ollama与PRISM任务，便于持续基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法为实用地形式化验证越来越强大的LLM策略奠定基础，支持对用户指定的序贯决策任务进行持续基准测试，但当前开源LLM在任务性能上仍落后于专业强化学习模型。

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化科研需要同时产生新颖且合理的高层计划并在动态不确定环境中正确执行，称为双层（bilevel）挑战

Method: Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework

Result: 在ACLAward和Laboratory等基准上，DLMA生成的科研论文在自动评估上达到或超越最先进水平，显著优于强基线

Conclusion: 进化环节负责创新，执行环节保证方案可行，两者缺一不可；DLMA在自动化科研任务中有效提升产出质量。

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

TL;DR: ATF通过将语法和一致性检查作为工具反馈整合进形式化生成过程，利用Lean4和多LLM评判提升生成质量，训练包含冷启动、专家迭代和DPO，实验证明优于基线并开源大规模合成数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 解决自动定理证明中训练数据稀缺问题，通过将自然语言数学问题翻译为形式化陈述，以提升ATP性能。

Method: 在模型生成过程中调用工具：用Lean4编译器进行语法修正，用多LLM评判器评估语义一致性；训练分三阶段：冷启动合成工具调用数据、专家迭代增强能力、使用DPO减少无效改写；最终通过人类评估和实验验证性能提升。

Result: 提出ATF（带工具反馈的自动形式化器），引入Lean4编译器进行语法校正和多LLM评判器进行语义一致性验证，训练流程包括冷启动合成工具调用数据、专家迭代和直接偏好优化，显著提升语法有效性和语义一致性，并开源Numina-ATF 75万合成形式化语句数据集。

Conclusion: ATF显著提高了自动形式化模型在语法与语义上的可靠性，具备良好推理扩展性，并通过开源数据集推动领域发展。

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出将GRPO与基于汤普森采样的树搜索结合的TGPR框架，有效平衡探索与利用，提升迭代精炼的搜索效率与性能，在代码生成基准上显著优于GRPO基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 既有迭代精炼方法依赖预定义启发式策略，无法在探索-利用权衡中根据历史精炼结果自适应，导致搜索效率低下与策略学习不足。

Method: Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR)

Result: 在HumanEval、MBPP和APPS基准上，相较于GRPO基线，在pass@1（MBPP）上最多提升4.2个百分点，在pass@10（APPS）上最多提升12.51个百分点；训练轨迹更稠密，策略更自适应。

Conclusion: TGPR通过将学习到的策略与结构化树搜索方法结合，为增强LLM的迭代精炼与有状态推理提供了一般性框架，能主动探索成功与失败路径，实现更高效的策略学习与问题解决。

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个面向AJAN的IDE，集成语义Web标准与行为树，并结合LLM以降低建模难度，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AJAN使用语义Web标准，但在实际建模中，URI管理和复杂SPARQL查询的高学习成本仍是主要障碍；因此需要一个工具来降低出错率并扩大用户群。

Method: 基于AJAN框架，作者将知识表示(RDF/RDFS, OWL)与行为树和SPARQL查询结合，并在开发环境中集成了工具来处理URI错误、简化SPARQL查询构造，同时提供与LLMs的接口以自动生成或补全知识、查询和行为模型。

Result: 论文实现并展示了一个IDE，证明其能减少由于手动编写URI和SPARQL导致的错误，提升建模效率，并通过示例展示了LLM在自动生成或辅助编写行为规则和查询方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个集成开发环境，以简化基于AJAN框架的多智能体系统建模，并引入了大规模语言模型（LLMs）来降低使用RDF/RDFS、OWL和SPARQL进行行为定义的门槛。

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes entropy-based stepwise information density and local/global uniformity metrics to evaluate LLM reasoning traces; higher uniformity correlates with and predicts better reasoning, improving selection and accuracy significantly


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test whether step-level uniform information flow (UID) correlates with reasoning quality in LLM-generated chain-of-thought; provide quantitative diagnostics and selection criteria

Method: Entropy-based stepwise information density and uniformity metrics for LLM reasoning traces

Result: Entropy-based stepwise information density metric; local and global uniformity scores; across six benchmarks, selecting traces with higher uniformity improves reasoning accuracy (e.g., 10-32% relative gains on AIME2025); correct traces avoid sharp spikes whereas incorrect ones show bursts

Conclusion: UID-inspired information density uniformity is an effective diagnostic and selection signal for building more reliable LLM reasoning systems

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有LLM在需要实时知识或复杂算术工具时表现欠佳，单纯推理无法替代外部工具，需将多跳推理与工具调用结合以提升性能与效率。

Method: 基于改良的Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO)，引入专门处理工具调用的策略，使模型在生成推理过程时能够动态决定何时调用外部工具（如搜索API、Python解释器），并通过强化学习优化工具调用策略与生成质量。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B与7B上，TAPO在涉及外部知识与数学计算的任务上达到了同参数方法中的SOTA，数据集为TAPO-easy-60K与TAPO-hard-18K；工具调用更高效，避免了因奖励设计导致的过度调用。

Conclusion: TAPO有效整合多跳推理与自适应工具调用，提升了在需外部知识与复杂计算任务上的表现，同时提高工具调用效率并抑制奖励驱动的过度调用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: construct diverse LLM agents by conditioning on small human demo sets and selecting representative subset via submodular optimization; outperforms baselines in crowdsourcing and education tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are cheaper than human labels but produce homogeneous outputs; need diverse set of agents to represent human population diversity

Method: submodular selection of LLM agents via in-context demos

Result: developed methods using submodular optimization with time/performance trade-offs; experiments show better representation of human populations and reproduce behavior patterns

Conclusion: submodular-based selection of in-context demo-conditioned LLM agents effectively captures human behavioral diversity and reproduces target population behaviors

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Motivation: 尽管poss-programs的语义与性质已被研究，但尚缺乏针对可能性逻辑程序的归纳学习方法，因此需要设计从背景知识和示例中学习poss-programs的算法。

Method: 首先形式化了归纳任务与相关性质，随后提出两种归纳算法 ilpsm（较完整）和 ilpsmmin（更简化、实现的版本）；实现了 ilpsmmin 原型并进行随机数据集实验评估。

Result: 提出并分析了归纳任务，给出 ilpsm 与 ilpsmmin 算法并实现了后者；实验结果显示在随机生成数据集上，所实现原型在普通逻辑程序输入下优于主流的稳定模型归纳学习系统。

Conclusion: 本文成功定义了poss-programs的归纳任务，给出并实现了有效算法（尤其是 ilpsmmin），实验验证了方法在随机数据集上对传统归纳学习系统有性能优势。

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Motivation: 手工设计高性能VRP启发式既费时又需要领域知识；现有LLM代码生成虽有潜力但尚不能直接超越人类专家

Method: 框架用LLM按问题生成可插拔operator，然后在元启发式（遗传算法）中进行搜索与优化，保证正确性并促进策略多样性；评估包括CVRP、VRPTW和PCVRP

Result: 在多个VRP任务上发现的操作符优于手工启发式和近期基于学习的方法，成为第一个用LLM推进VRP最先进水平的范式

Conclusion: VRPAgent通过将LLM生成的操作符嵌入通用元启发式框架，并用遗传搜索对其进行优化，证明了自动生成的启发式能在多种VRP变体上超过人工设计和现有学习方法，且计算资源需求低（单核CPU）

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Compared planning with actions (PwA) vs planning with schemas (PwS); identified when PwS becomes advantageous as action space grows and how model capacity affects this; suggested improvements for PwS


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional action lists become impractical as environment action space explodes; need scalable action representation for long-horizon tasks

Method: systematic empirical study

Result: Found representation-choice inflection point between ~35 and ~500 actions; stronger planning moves inflection right, better schema instantiation moves it left; provided guide to improve PwS agents

Conclusion: PwS scales better for large combinatorial action spaces; trade-offs depend on planning ability and schema instantiation; provide recommendations to build better PwS agents

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将海德格尔与尼采哲学思想与现代强化学习结合：通过“在世”“向死”两项生命条件导出维持完整性的稳态驱动与追求多样性的内在控制驱动（如empowerment），形式化为RL框架以促进具身智能体在开放多智能体环境中发展开放性与关怀能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能常规避脆弱性与死亡，导致难以适应开放物理世界与提供关怀；而生物体在开放环境中高效生存、适应与关怀，启发研究如何通过生命条件来改进人工智能的鲁棒性、适应性与关怀能力。

Method: 在理论层面，作者从哲学出发定义了具身条件，构建了驱动体系（稳态驱动与内在控制驱动），并将这些概念形式化到强化学习框架中以便在开放式多智能体环境中分析其行为后果。

Result: 论文主要给出概念框架和数学形式化，论证内在的控制最大化驱动力（如empowerment）可支持满足未来稳态需求，从而促进具身智能体的开放性与关怀潜能；未给出大规模实证结果，但为后续实验和算法设计提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出将海德格尔存在论的“在世存在”和“向死而存”作为物理具身智能体的两项最小条件，认为由此可衍生出维持自我完整性的本体稳态驱动与追求多样性行为的内在驱动，并以尼采的权力意志类比将最大化对未来状态控制（如empowerment）视为一种能提高满足未来稳态需求能力的内在动机。

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用LLMs将自然语言领域知识转为声明式规则，指导IMr流程发现，构建交互式工具并通过实验与真实案例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件日志往往不完整或有噪声，单纯从日志发现的模型可能与真实流程不符。领域知识是重要补充，但通常被忽视。将专家知识纳入流程发现可提升模型可靠性和下游任务的可信度。

Method: 构建交互式工作流：领域专家以自然语言提供规则描述；使用LLMs抽取声明式规则；将规则馈入IMr发现算法，递归地结合日志与规则构建模型；框架协调LLM、专家和后端服务；实现了完整工具并评估不同LLMs与提示工程策略。

Result: 开发并实现了一个支持该交互流程的工具，进行了大量实验比较不同LLMs与提示策略，并在真实事件日志上开展了包含域专家参与的案例研究。评估显示该框架能有效抽取规则并引导发现算法避免与知识冲突的结构，提升模型可用性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个将领域知识（以自然语言形式）与事件日志结合的交互式流程发现框架，通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从专家文本中抽取声明式规则，并将其引入IMr算法，从而生成更符合实际的流程模型。实现了工具并进行了多模型、多提示策略的实验评估与真实案例研究，结果表明该方法在可用性和有效性上具有优势。

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NewtonBench通过‘形而上学转变’生成大规模、难以背诵的物理规律发现任务，并要求模型通过交互实验发现隐藏规律。结果显示大型模型在简单场景能发现规律，但对复杂性和噪声极为敏感，工具辅助有时反而带来负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测在科学相关性、可扩展性与抗记忆化之间存在三难困境，且低估了科学发现的交互动态性，需一个更真实、可扩展且抗背诵的基准来衡量模型的真正发现能力。

Method: 通过对规范物理定律实施系统化的形而上学转变，生成324个任务；并构建交互式模拟环境，要求代理通过实验探测揭示隐藏规律，评估模型在不同复杂度、噪声和工具辅助下的表现。

Result: NewtonBench引入了可规模化且抗记忆化的物理学规律发现评测，通过“形而上学转变”系统化改变规范物理定律，生成了324个跨12个物理领域的任务，并将评估从静态拟合提升为需要交互式探测复杂模拟系统的发现过程。实验表明，前沿大模型具备一定但脆弱的发现能力：随系统复杂性增加和观测噪声升高，性能迅速下降；使用代码解释器等工具有时会降低更强模型的表现，因为工具促使模型过早从探索转为利用，从而满足于次优解。NewtonBench为复杂交互环境中的稳健、可推广规律发现提供了可扩展且科学上真实的基准。

Conclusion: 尽管最先进的大语言模型展示了初步的发现能力，但在复杂、带噪的交互式系统中仍然远未解决，NewtonBench为衡量和推动真正的科学发现代理发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

*Pulkit Rustagi,Kyle Hollins Wray,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LCBS：在MO-MAPF中用字典序偏好替代求帕累托前沿，结合优先感知的A*与冲突基搜索，高效找到首选最优解，能扩展到多达10个目标且优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MO-MAPF methods compute Pareto frontiers and don't optimize user preferences; they scale poorly with many objectives. Need to directly compute a single solution aligned with lexicographic preferences and scale better.

Method: Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) for MO-MAPF

Result: Proposed LCBS integrates priority-aware low-level A* with conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction. Empirically computes optimal solutions and scales to up to ten objectives, outperforming baselines on benchmarks and random instances.

Conclusion: LCBS能在给定字典序目标偏好的情况下高效且最优地求解MO-MAPF，显著提高成功率并扩展到更多目标维度。

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

Motivation: 让媒体研究员/分析师能用自然语言而非复杂的过滤界面快速检索历史比赛片段，提高工作效率并释放创造性时间。

Method: 提出一个基于代理(agentic)的工作流：接收自然语言查询，拆解为元素，翻译为底层数据库查询语言；并通过语义缓存优化准确性与延迟。

Result: 系统在与 NFL 合作的场景中达到超过95%的准确率，平均检索时间从10分钟降至30秒。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了将生成式 AI 应用于媒体检索的实用系统，显著提升了检索准确率与效率。

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.

TL;DR: integration of biomedical KG into diffusion noise schedules yields realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic EHR trajectories for ultra-rare diseases


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: generate privacy-preserving synthetic EHRs for ultra-rare diseases using knowledge graphs

Method: analysis

Result: improved fidelity and privacy; lower MMD and low membership inference AUROC

Conclusion: knowledge-guided diffusion improves both data utility and privacy, enabling safer data sharing

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MCCE，一种将封闭强模型与可训练小模型结合的协同进化框架，用于多目标离散优化（如分子设计），通过轨迹记忆和强化学习迭代提升小模型，使两者互补，实验证明在药物设计基准上取得了更好帕累托前沿质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标离散优化空间巨大且无结构，传统进化算法易陷入局部最优；封闭大型LLM具备强先验与推理但不能持续学习经验；小模型能持续学习但缺乏广泛知识。结合两者可同时获得知识驱动的探索与经验驱动的持续改进。

Method: 设计一个混合框架：保持一个冻结的封闭源LLM与一个轻量可训练模型；记录搜索轨迹记忆；用强化学习（基于轨迹记忆的回报信号）逐步微调小模型；两模型在搜索过程中协同产生和筛选候选解，互相补强探索能力。

Result: 在多目标药物设计基准上，MCCE在帕累托前沿质量上达到或超越最先进方法，稳定优于基线方法，展示混合LLM持续进化的新范式。

Conclusion: MCCE有效结合封闭大型LLM的知识与可训练小模型的可持续学习能力，通过互相启发（非蒸馏）实现持续进化，在多目标分子设计任务上显著优于现有基线，提升帕累托前沿质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种将实值表格数据转为复值表示的方法，并基于此构建复值随机向量函数链接网络RVFL-X，在80个UCI数据集上优于原RVFL和SOTA RNN变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage the representational benefits of complex numbers in randomized neural networks (RNNs) by providing methods to convert real-valued tabular data into complex-valued representations, enabling the use of complex-valued RNNs.

Method: 提出自然变换（可能基于将部分特征映射为实部/虚部或相位振幅编码）和自编码器驱动的变换来生成复值表示；在此基础上构建复值RVFL-X，随机初始化复值权重与激活，保持输出层线性训练以保证效率。

Result: They propose two transformation methods (a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven method) and introduce RVFL-X, a complex-valued extension of the RVFL network that integrates complex inputs, weights, and activations while outputting real values; RVFL-X outperforms original RVFL and SOTA RNN variants on 80 UCI datasets.

Conclusion: RVFL-X 有效利用复数表示提升了随机神经网络在实值表格任务上的表现，且方法简单高效，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

Motivation: 目标是实现手机拍照自动识别结，从而把视觉识别与拓扑不变量计算结合，利用机器学习处理噪声图像并用不变量进行严格拓扑区分。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN和视觉transformer作为基线，直接从结图像回归或分类交点数；计划将感知结果转换为平面图（PD）编码，之后应用传统算法计算琼斯多项式等不变量以实现最终分类。

Result: 本工作展示了一个将机器学习与传统拓扑不变量结合，用于从结的照片中识别结的策略。作者使用CNN和transformer等现代视觉模型对结图像进行感知，作为基线直接预测交点数，并证明轻量级模型也能恢复有意义的结构信息。进一步目标是将感知模块与符号重构（生成平面图PD编码）结合，以便对生成的PD码计算如琼斯多项式等量子不变量，形成两阶段流程：机器学习处理噪声视觉数据，拓扑不变量保证严格的分类区分。

Conclusion: 两阶段结合机器学习与拓扑不变量是一条可行路径：前者处理视觉噪声，后者提供严格的拓扑区分。即便是轻量模型，也能提取出对重建有用的结构信息，未来可通过端到端或模块化的改进实现从图像到不变量的自动化管道。

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有基于扩散模型的轨迹生成方法多采用卷积架构，容量与建模能力受限，导致生成轨迹在街道级别出现显著偏差和细节丢失。引入transformer旨在提升建模能力，捕捉更复杂的时空依赖，从而生成更真实的轨迹。

Method: 使用transformer作为条件信息嵌入与噪声预测网络，替换以往基于卷积的噪声预测（如UNet）。设计并比较两种GPS坐标嵌入策略：位置嵌入（可能类似于序列位置编码）与经纬度嵌入（直接编码地理坐标）。在不同尺度下分析模型表现，训练并评估于两个真实轨迹数据集。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上，Trajectory Transformer在生成质量指标上显著优于基线（基于UNet的扩散模型），并有效缓解了轨迹偏离问题，保持了更丰富的街道级细节。

Conclusion: Trajectory Transformer在轨迹生成任务上显著提高了生成质量，减少了先前方法常见的偏移问题，表明transformer骨干更适合捕捉复杂时空依赖与精细地理细节。

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

TL;DR: BlockGPT predicts full frames each step via batched-token autoregressive transformer; improves accuracy and localization for precipitation nowcasting and greatly speeds up inference vs token-based and diffusion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predict short-term precipitation (nowcasting) with models that are accurate and real-time efficient; overcome limitations of token-based autoregressive models and expensive diffusion models.

Method: Introduce batched tokenization (Block) and BlockGPT architecture: factorize space-time, self-attention within frames, causal attention across frames, autoregressive generation of 2D fields; evaluated against NowcastingGPT and DiffCast+Phydnet on KNMI and SEVIR datasets.

Result: BlockGPT, an autoregressive transformer with batched tokenization predicting full 2D frames per timestep, using within-frame self-attention and causal across-frame attention; outperforms baselines on KNMI and SEVIR, better accuracy and localization, up to 31x faster inference.

Conclusion: BlockGPT is a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction that factorizes space-time and enables fast, accurate precipitation nowcasting, offering superior performance and much faster inference than token-based and diffusion methods.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

TL;DR: SDAR将已训练自回归模型轻量适配为块式离散扩散模型：按块自回归保证全局连贯，块内用离散扩散并行生成，低成本保留AR性能并显著提速，同时增强推理与领域适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解端到端扩散训练成本高、掩码扩散并行推理效率不足的问题，同时保留AR模型训练时的计算高效性，并实现高吞吐量并行生成。

Method: 通过对已训练的AR模型进行轻量级、数据高效的适配，将其转换为块式离散扩散模型；推理时按块自回归生成以保证全局一致性，并在每个块内通过离散扩散并行解码所有token。

Result: 在多个实验中，SDAR证明了AR模型比掩码扩散模型更具计算效率；SDAR以极低成本实现AR到扩散的转换，规模化研究表明对密集和MoE架构均能扩展，大模型对块大小和解码阈值更鲁棒，带来更大速度提升且无精度损失；30B MoE在科学推理基准上优于AR模型，并可通过测试时扩展方法（如多数投票、pass@k）进一步提升。

Conclusion: SDAR成功将自回归模型的训练效率与扩散模型的并行推理能力结合，达到在保留AR性能的同时实现块内并行生成，从而加速推理并提升推理和领域适应能力。

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

TL;DR: Monolithic foundation models struggle with self-adaptation in high-dimensional, dynamically evolving systems; decentralized networks of specialized small agents that learn via swarm interactions can adapt better with limited data, improving decisions in complex domains like intensive care but sacrificing detailed reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze limits of monolithic foundation models in dynamic, high-dimensional real-world decision tasks (e.g., ICU treatment) and propose decentralized small agent networks to enable self-adaptation with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge.

Method: Propose decentralized SAN architecture where agents specialize on system subfunctions; employ mathematical analysis of learning behavior and evidence from applications to support that diverse swarm-learning enables self-adaptive coordination among agents, outperforming monolithic models in dynamic tasks.

Result: The paper argues curse of dimensionality prevents efficient self-adaptation by monolithic models; proposes interacting small agent networks (SANs) and swarm-learning to achieve superior adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments, with trade-off of reduced reproducibility.

Conclusion: SANs and diverse swarm-learning can overcome conceptual limits of monolithic models for self-adaptation in dynamic complex systems, offering superior performance under limited data and mechanistic knowledge, though they reduce reproducibility in fine details.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

TL;DR: 在去中心化学习网络中加入性能预测器，用预测的后悔指标进行上下文感知加权，可比传统历史加权更快适应变化并提升集成预测效果，但对特征与训练超参敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性加权方法（包括历史平均与指数加权）对阶段性或制度性变化反应迟缓，无法预测未来模型的相对表现；通过预测性能可以实现前瞻性的权重调整。

Method: 引入一个性能预测器节点，使用机器学习模型预测每个工作者在未来时间点的表现（如后悔值或后悔z分数），并据此动态分配权重；在Allora网络类似的去中心化架构中进行实验与优化测试。

Result: 发现预测后悔值或后悔z分数的模型较直接预测损失更能提升网络推断性能，且性能对特征集选择和训练轮数敏感，需要按具体问题调优。

Conclusion: 本文提出通过对参与者预测性能进行预测来改进分散学习网络的预测组合，从而实现上下文感知的权重分配，提高网络推断准确性。

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

TL;DR: 提出PIKAN，将物理先验（自由空间损耗、两径反射等）作为灵感偏置嵌入网络，既保留可解释符号表达又达到与深度学习相当的精度，参数量仅232，比MLP轻最多37倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决确定性模型可解释但僵化、DL模型准确但不可解释的问题，需一种既有物理指引又具灵活学习能力的模型用于非平稳空地信道。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold分解设计网络结构，使用物理项作为可学习/可调节的归纳偏置，训练时兼顾测量数据拟合与物理一致性。

Result: PIKAN embeds physical laws into neural network architecture for UAV A2G channel modeling.

Conclusion: PIKAN在精度、可解释性和参数效率上取得平衡，适合非平稳UAV A2G信道建模，可为超5G/6G提供可解释模型。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升在向量处理器（尤其是RISC-V ISA）上运行注意力机制的性能，同时避免因新增自定义指令而增加ISA复杂性或实现成本。

Method: 对FlashAttention进行全面向量化：将标量代码最小化，采用低成本浮点指数近似（替代精确exp），并设计适合向量处理器的tiling策略来优化内存访问，保持在现有RISC-V向量ISA上实现。

Result: 本工作在RISC-V向量处理器上实现并加速了FlashAttention算法，目标是减少标量代码并简化Softmax中指数计算的复杂度，通过低成本浮点指数近似避免扩展ISA，结合合适的tiling提高内存局部性，实验表明在实际注意力层中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 向量化实现与指数近似和tiling策略相结合，可在不扩展RISC-V向量ISA的前提下高效加速FlashAttention，适用于实际Attention层。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Motivation: 量化神经常微分方程（Neural ODEs）解是否为物理上对应的欧拉-拉格朗日方程，并构建度量来辨别与学习拉格朗日结构。

Method: 定义Helmholtz metrics（基于Helmholtz条件）来评估ODE是否来源于变分原理；将该度量整合到二阶神经ODE框架，训练生成满足或近似满足欧拉-拉格朗日结构的动力学模型；在含噪实验基准上对比Lagrangian neural ODE与普通神ural ODE的性能，验证区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: Helmholtz metrics可量化ODE的拉格朗日相似性；Lagrangian neural ODE能在仅用位置数据时有效学习与区分欧拉-拉格朗日系统，并在噪声情况下表现出更好的解和物理一致性。

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPMM-CFL：将Dirichlet过程先验融入聚类联邦学习，自动推断簇数并耦合簇推断与联邦更新，实验证明在不同非IID分区下性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类联邦学习大多需要事先固定簇数K，当潜在结构未知时不实用。因此引入DP先验以自动确定簇数并更灵活地适应客户端异质性。

Method: 在联邦学习迭代中对每簇参数施加Dirichlet过程先验，采用非参数贝叶斯推断同时推断簇数量和客户端归属，同时执行每簇内的联邦更新；在每轮中将联邦更新与簇推断耦合执行。

Result: 在基准数据集（包括Dirichlet划分和按类别划分的非IID设置）上验证了算法，结果显示该方法能有效推断簇数并在非IID场景下提升性能（文中声称优于固定K的方法）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Dirichlet过程的聚类联邦学习方法（DPMM-CFL），用于在客户端异质性下自动确定簇数并分配客户端，实现每簇联邦目标的联合优化。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

TL;DR: Introduces RT that tokenizes table cells with metadata, pretrained with masked token prediction and uses Relational Attention to enable strong zero-shot and fine-tuned performance across relational tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable transfer across diverse relational datasets/tasks without per-dataset fine-tuning by handling schema/structural heterogeneity

Method: Relational Transformer architecture; tokenization with metadata; masked token prediction pretraining; Relational Attention over columns, rows, PK-FK links

Result: Zero-shot: 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary tasks with 22M model; outperforms 27B LLM (84%); fine-tuning achieves SOTA with high sample efficiency

Conclusion: RT is a practical foundation-model approach for relational data, leveraging schema-aware tokenization and relational attention to transfer across unseen databases/tasks without dataset-specific tuning

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

*Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCPS augments node exploration with statistics from playouts containing entire root-to-node paths, giving better results than GRAVE in two-player games and similar results in multi-player games, with improved weighting formulas and robustness to hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve MCTS performance where deep RL or heavy precomputation unavailable; leverage permutation/amaf statistics across paths to boost selection when resources limited.

Method: Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS) vs GRAVE

Result: MCPS outperforms GRAVE on tested two-player games, matches performance on multi-player games; benefits from using abstract move codes; mathematical derivation removes GRAVE's bias hyperparameter and reduces sensitivity to ref hyperparameter.

Conclusion: MCPS is a general-purpose, hyperparameter-robust MCTS variant improving GRAVE by aggregating permutation statistics and using derived weighting formulas; it's especially effective in two-player games and when compute/pretraining is limited.

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文给出第一个适用于多类任务的完美真实校准度量，既保证预测器不被诱导撒谎，又在分箱参数变化下保持排序鲁棒性，理论与实验证明其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准度量常常不具真实性，会鼓励预测器通过作弊获得更好的校准分数；此前只有二分类任务存在完美真实度量，缺乏多类推广，因此需要设计一个在多类任务中也能保证真实性且具有鲁棒性的校准度量。

Method: 作者在理论上构建了一个多类校准度量，分析了从二分类到多类扩展常用方法是否保持真实性，并证明其度量在任意分箱参数下保持主导/被主导预测器排序不变性；同时进行了实验验证以支持理论结论。

Result: 构造了第一个多类完美真实校准度量，识别了哪些多类扩展方案会破坏真实性，并证明该度量在任意分箱设置下都稳健地保持预测器间的优劣排序；实验结果与理论一致，显示优于分箱ECE的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个针对多类预测任务的完美真实（perfectly truthful）校准度量，推广了Hartline et al. [2025]在二分类上的工作，解决了此前方法在多类情形下真实性缺失的问题，并在数学上证明并实证显示该度量在排序鲁棒性方面优于传统分箱ECE。

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

Motivation: 研究非欧几里得基础模型（如双曲几何表示）中是否存在几何特有的后门漏洞，以及这些漏洞如何被触发和防御的内在限制。

Method: 理论分析边界放大效应以及防御的限制；构造几何自适应触发器；在多任务多架构上进行实证评估，比较攻击成功率和检测器性能随到边界距离的变化。

Result: 发现边界驱动的不对称性：靠近边界的小输入扰动对输入空间检测器看似微弱，但会在表示空间引发巨大变化，从而被后门触发利用。提出一种几何自适应触发器，并实验证明攻击成功率在靠近边界时上升，而传统检测器效果下降。

Conclusion: 非欧几里得表示的边界效应构成模型特有的后门脆弱点；通过沿半径向内拉动可抑制触发但会牺牲性能，防御存在本质权衡；研究为设计更合理的检测和防御方法提供了分析依据。

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

TL;DR: 用信息不平衡分析隐藏表征，发现表征信息随模型规模呈double descent；过度参数化使表征对标签噪声鲁棒；随机标签训练依然会使网络主动编码标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管标签噪声对分类性能影响被广泛研究，但其对网络隐藏表征的影响尚不清楚，本文旨在填补这一空白，理解标签噪声如何改变表示学习与泛化行为。

Method: 使用信息不平衡（Information Imbalance）作为条件互信息的高效代理，系统性比较不同设置下的隐藏表征；考察参数规模从欠参数化到过参数化的影响；比较干净标签、带噪标签和随机标签下的表征；分析penultimate与pre-softmax层的信息不平衡与交叉熵的关系。

Result: 发现表征信息随参数数量呈双重下降；欠参数化时噪声标签产生更富信息的表征，过度参数化时噪声与干净标签产生相当信息量的表征；过度参数化下penultimate与pre-softmax的信息不平衡随交叉熵降低而减小；随机标签训练导致的表征表现甚至比随机特征差，表明存在超出懒惰学习的权重调整。

Conclusion: 过度参数化网络的表征对标签噪声具有稳健性；在欠参数化时，带噪标签学到的表征比干净标签更具信息性；当参数数量变化时，隐藏表征信息量呈双重下降（double descent）现象，类似测试误差的行为；对偶层（penultimate 与 pre-softmax）之间的信息不平衡随交叉熵损失在过度参数化下减小；用随机标签训练得到的表征比随机特征表现更差，说明网络在随机标签下并非懒惰学习，而是权重适配以编码标签信息。

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Result: Portfolios of specialist models outperform portfolios of independently trained generalists; ensembling/model selection achieve competitive benchmark performance with far fewer parameters; post-training base models effectively creates diverse specialists; ensembling/model selection more compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning

Conclusion: 构建专家型模型组合并采用集成或模型选择是比单一大模型更参数和算力高效的替代方案，post-training是一种生成多样化专家的高效方法。

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic

applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections

is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more

### [74] [Nearly Instance-Optimal Parameter Recovery from Many Trajectories via Hellinger Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06434)
*Eliot Shekhtman,Yichen Zhou,Ingvar Ziemann,Nikolai Matni,Stephen Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Hellinger localization for multi-trajectory sequential learning, giving instance-optimal rates (full-sample scaling) in various models where prior approaches gave weaker i.i.d. or mixing-time-deflated guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend instance-optimal statistical learning guarantees to multi-trajectory sequential data settings, beyond existing results limited to least-squares or requiring mixing assumptions. It addresses practical modern training scenarios (many independent time-series) and seeks sample-efficient bounds without reducing to pessimistic i.i.d. or mixing-based rates.

Method: Two-step method: reduce control of squared Hellinger distance at path-measure level to an i.i.d. learning problem, then apply localization to approximate Hellinger by a quadratic in parameter space weighted by trajectory Fisher information, yielding sharp instance-dependent bounds.

Result: They develop a Hellinger localization framework for maximum likelihood estimation in multi-trajectory settings, controlling path-measure Hellinger distance then localizing to a quadratic form weighted by trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds scaling with full data budget under broad conditions, and near-asymptotically optimal rates in four case studies.

Conclusion: The Hellinger localization approach broadens instance-optimal guarantees in multi-trajectory settings, providing near-optimal sample complexity across diverse models and outperforming standard reductions.

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and

TL;DR: 针对含不确定性的超参调优，本文构建统计代理并导出随机采集函数的闭式优化器，实现解析期望计算与显著的计算加速（高达40倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在含噪函数评估的情形下，超参数调优变得昂贵且不稳定，尤其是当目标参数为随机模型中的尺度或精度参数时，亟需一种能在不牺牲精度的前提下降低计算成本的高效优化方法。

Result: 提出了一种针对具有不确定性的超参数调优的贝叶斯优化框架，特别针对随机模型中的尺度或精度参数；通过对随机变量构造统计代理实现期望的解析计算，并导出随机采集函数优化器的闭式解，从而大幅降低每次迭代计算代价；相比一维蒙特卡洛方案，所需数据点减少约40倍，总体计算成本可降低至40倍。

Conclusion: 方法在两个计算工程数值例子中验证，能大幅减少所需数据点和计算成本，同时保持优化效果，适合优化尺度/精度类参数的随机模型。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移可迁移性指标用于在不微调且无源数据访问的情形下选取预训练模型，但用于评估这些指标的基准很少被审视，可能无法反映实际模型选择的复杂性。

Method: 通过实证分析比较不同评估基准下指标表现，考察模型空间多样性、性能等级静态性等因素，并展示简单数据集无关的启发式方法在这些不合理基准上优于复杂方法的情况。

Result: 发现常用基准的模型空间不现实、性能等级静态，导致评估失真；并提出构建更健壮、真实基准的具体建议。

Conclusion: 当前常用的迁移可迁移性评估基准存在严重缺陷，导致现有指标的性能被人为高估。

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出注意力沉降(attention sinks)和表征压缩(compression valleys)源于残差流中巨大的激活，并给出理论证明与实验证据，提出Mix-Compress-Refine信息流理论解释Transformer模型的三阶段处理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一解释先前独立研究的注意力沉降与压缩谷现象，揭示其共同根源并构建信息流理论以解释层次计算组织。

Method: 理论证明大激活必然引起熵减少并建立边界；在多个规模(410M-120B)模型上通过观测中间层BOS激活范数、压缩和注意力模式，并做针对性消融来验证理论。

Result: 证明并实证：中间层BOS出现极端激活时，同时观察到压缩谷和注意力汇聚；消融实验支持理论；提出Mix-Compress-Refine理论并用其解释任务层次表现差异。

Conclusion: 大激活导致表示压缩并伴随注意力汇聚；模型在深度上分为混合-压缩-精炼三阶段，这解释了不同任务在中间层或全层表现差异。

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

*Sanjeda Akter,Ibne Farabi Shihab,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDFL uses self-normalized e-processes tracking log-likelihood lift vs skeletons to provide anytime-valid stopping; cuts tokens ~25% and preserves formal error control but not full factual correctness — good as verification filter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need formal, delta-level error control for stopping LM generation early while ensuring sufficient information, handling unknown centering and drift, and reducing verification cost.

Method: Sequential-EDFL: anytime-valid sequential testing for LM stopping

Result: Reduces generation by 22-28% vs sequential baselines, maintains delta-level control with 12% overhead; EDFL reduces verifier burden by 83% but doesn't guarantee factual correctness (10.9% incorrect with gate).

Conclusion: EDFL gives formal anytime-valid information sufficiency certificates, works with automated skeletons and correctness gate to reduce verification load, but cannot replace downstream verification in safety-critical tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

### [79] [GUIDE: Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06502)
*Khoa Trinh,Gaurav Menghani,Erik Vee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Guide，一种通过在参数空间强制学生匹配教师的蒸馏方法（Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings），在大型学生模型（400M–1B参数）上训练约200亿token时，能将教师-学生质量差距减少25–26%。Guide可与传统知识蒸馏结合，带来近加成的提升；单独使用时也明显优于仅使用KD。该方法不增加训练或推理开销，因而性能提升“几乎免费”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准蒸馏仅让学生匹配教师输出，未充分利用教师模型中更丰富的参数/表示信息；考虑到训练大模型代价高，应从教师中提取更多有用信息以提升学生质量。

Method: Guide通过在参数空间对齐学生与教师嵌入（参数初始化与嵌入蒸馏），即对学生参数进行受教师引导的初始化与蒸馏，使学生在训练中更接近教师，从而提高性能。方法可与输出层的知识蒸馏结合使用。

Result: 在约20B tokens训练下，使用400M–1B参数的学生模型，Guide将教师-学生质量差距降低25–26%；Guide与知识蒸馏可近乎加成地提升性能，且Guide单独使用优于仅用知识蒸馏；无额外开销。

Conclusion: Guide显著缩小了教师和学生之间的质量差距（约25–26%），可与知识蒸馏叠加，且不增加训练/推理成本，适用于大规模学生模型训练。

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排行榜用于评估生成式AI能力但易受对手操纵，尤其通过去匿名化识别模型后进行排名操纵；需要评估文生图场景下这类威胁强度并提出度量和防御建议。

Method: 收集19个不同组织、架构和规模的生成模型输出（280个提示、约15万张图像），将图像编码到CLIP嵌入空间，并训练实时分类器对生成模型进行识别；还定义并计算提示级可分离性度量以识别高风险提示。

Result: 在CLIP嵌入空间中，简单的实时分类器能在无提示控制或历史数据下高准确率识别模型；部分提示具有高可分离性，可实现近乎完美的去匿名化；实验数据涵盖广泛模型和大量图像，证明该问题比LLM场景更严重。

Conclusion: 实验表明文生图排行榜面临更高的去匿名化风险，且存在一些提示使得模型识别几乎完美，因而需要更强的防御措施以防止排名操纵。

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

Conclusion: ATLO-ML能显著改善时间序列预测精度，尤其在空气质量数据上；方法具有通用性，可应用于其他时间敏感任务。

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CrossLayer Extraction，通过跨层信息交互在硬标签设置下更高效地提取ReLU网络参数，避免了先前方法在深层时的指数查询开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出现有对硬标签模型提取的多项式时间可行性主张在深度增长时依赖不现实的假设，提出新的跨层方法以应对查询复杂度随深度指数增长的问题。

Method: 不直接提取单个神经元的权重/偏置，而是构造利用多层神经元交互的查询策略，从高层输出反推出低层参数信息，从而减少所需查询次数。

Result: 该论文提出了一种名为CrossLayer Extraction的新型模型提取攻击方法，针对ReLU网络在硬标签（仅返回类别）场景中提取内部参数的问题。作者指出之前的工作（如Carlini et al.）所依赖的一些假设在攻击深层网络时需要指数级查询，这使得其多项式时间可行性不成立。新方法通过利用跨层神经元的相互作用，从更深层获取信息，从而显著降低查询复杂度并缓解现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: CrossLayer Extraction在理论上和实践上都能降低查询复杂度，使得在硬标签环境下对深层ReLU网络的模型提取更高效，弥补了先前方法的限制。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

Motivation: 实际部署的机器学习系统面临混合的未标注数据，直接利用这些数据用于OOD检测困难重重；需要一种稳健、不易受噪声和异常样本影响的筛选机制来挑出OOD样本以改善检测器训练。

Method: 对无标签‘in-the-wild’数据应用中位数操作识别潜在离群点（OOD候选），利用这些候选与有标签InD数据联合训练OOD分类器；同时给出误差界证明方法收敛性与低错误率。

Result: 理论上给出误差界，表明方法能保证低错误率；实验证明在开放世界设置下，Medix在各项评测上均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: Medix通过基于中位数的无监督离群点筛选并结合有标签InD数据训练鲁棒OOD分类器，理论与实验证明其有效性，能在开放世界设置下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Motivation: 寻找满足‘计算无巧合’（computational no-coincidence）猜想的神经网络构造，从可解释性和对齐研究角度理解何种架构能产生几乎独立的输出。

Method: 基于对宽度趋于大时输出协方差和高阶矩分析，利用高斯积分性质和中心极限定理工具，证明零均值激活函数可抑制不同输出之间的相关性。

Result: 证明了零均值（在标准正态下）的非线性激活函数（如平移后的ReLU、GeLU和tanh）会导致近独立输出；标准ReLU和GeLU不满足该条件。

Conclusion: 随机初始化、宽网络且选择自然超参时，输出近乎独立当且仅当激活函数在高斯测度下均值为零。

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

Motivation: POMDP中信念状态连续且高维，直接求解最优策略计算复杂，因而通过将连续信念近似为基于有限历史的离散superstate，从而借用MDP算法简化学习问题。

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning autoregressive goal-conditioned policies on their own actions reduces incoherence, improves performance, and can be seen equivalently as control-as-inference, reward posterior folding, or temperature annealing; links to training-inference trade-off and effective horizon


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models yields incoherent policies; need to understand how re-training on self-generated actions reduces incoherence and affects returns

Method: Mathematical analysis of incoherence in RL fine-tuning

Result: Proved that re-training on model's own actions decreases incoherence and improves return; characterized policy trajectory via three-way correspondence between control-as-inference, folding posterior into reward, and temperature decrease in deterministic limit

Conclusion: Re-training on self-generated actions provides a principled way to reduce incoherence and improve returns, with theoretical correspondence to established frameworks and implications for effective planning horizon in soft-conditioned generative models.

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

TL;DR: 将推理拆为定长块并在块间保存短文本状态（Markovian Thinking/Delethink），可把上下文固定为常数大小，使计算从二次降为线性，从而在较低成本下实现远超原始LongCoT的超长思考长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL思考环境把整个已生成的思路作为状态，导致状态不可界定且注意力成本随思路长度二次增长，限制了可扩展性；因此需要一种使状态大小常数化的思考环境以降低计算开销并支持超长推理。

Method: 把长链思维分成固定大小的chunk；在chunk内部正常生成；chunk末端由环境重置上下文并用短‘carryover’文本初始化新chunk；通过RL奖励模型学习生成足够信息的carryover，从而实现无缝延续。

Result: Markovian Thinking and Delethink enable long-chain reasoning with constant-size state, yielding linear compute and memory savings compared to standard LongCoT-RL. Delethink trains models to write compact carryover state at chunk boundaries, allowing continuation over much longer total thinking lengths while retaining or improving performance.

Conclusion: 重设计思考环境（采用Markovian Thinking）是提高推理LLM可扩展性的有效杠杆：可以在恒定上下文大小下训练并运行极长的思维链，显著降低计算成本并保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI可助力临床试验关键环节（如受试者招募、终点评估、治疗反应预测），但未经防护的AI应用可能在直接影响试验结论的终点评估上带来风险，因此需要评估在不同模型性能下AI部署策略对试验结论的影响。

Method: 比较两种AI框架与人工评估，设计注入坏模型（随机猜测到简单启发式预测）以应对模型退化，使用两项随机对照试验（以脊柱X光影像为端点）评估成本、准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: AI-SR在所有考量下表现最佳：提供可靠的疾病估计、保持临床试验的治疗效应估计和结论稳定，并在不同人群中保持这些优势。其他AI框架在遇到坏模型时可能导致结论偏差或不稳定。

Conclusion: 使用AI作为辅助读者（AI-SR）在临床试验中最为合适，能在成本、准确性、鲁棒性和泛化性上满足要求，即便在注入性能极差的坏模型情况下也能维护试验结论。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

*Canyu Lei,Benjamin Lobo,Jianxin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPA-Net，从稀疏SMBG直接估计AGP指标，通过双路径（重构轨迹与多尺度ResNet预测）和注意力对齐降低偏差，在真实数据上表现良好，为无法使用CGM的场景提供决策支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Make AGP metrics estimation feasible where CGM is inaccessible by leveraging widely available but sparse SMBG data

Method: Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) combining reconstruction and direct prediction via attention and alignment

Result: DPA-Net reconstructs CGM-like trajectories, predicts AGP metrics accurately, reduces bias via alignment, uses active point selector; achieves robust accuracy on real-world dataset

Conclusion: DPA-Net是首个监督框架，用SMBG估计AGP指标，表现稳健，能在CGM不可及环境中支持临床决策

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

*Yong Liu,Di Fu,Yang Luo,Zirui Zhu,Minhao Cheng,Cho-Jui Hsieh,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POME is a zero-cost post-processing of weight differences using truncated SVD on delta weights to denoise and re-balance updates, improving performance across tasks and model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve fine-tuned LLM performance without extra data or further training by post-processing model weight updates.

Method: Compute delta W = fine-tuned - pretrained weights; apply truncated SVD to delta W to equalize dominant update directions and remove small singular values; reconstruct projected delta W and add to pretrained checkpoint as post-processed fine-tuned model.

Result: POME applies muon-style projection via truncated SVD to delta weights, equalizing dominant directions and pruning small singular values, yielding +2.5% on GSM8K and +1.0% on code generation across 7B–72B models.

Conclusion: POME is a universal, zero-overhead method to enhance fine-tuned models by post-processing weight updates, compatible with any optimizer or distributed setup.

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

Conclusion: 集成稀疏传感器与HydroNet可在有限部署下实现网络范围的高精度泄漏检测，且可扩展到其他地下管网，具备实用推广价值。

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Motivation: 多层α-散度NMF在表达能力上更强，但现有方法难以保证在深层结构下的收敛性；借鉴物理化学能量势垒的概念可能为收敛性提供新的理论工具，从而设计更稳健的多层NMF算法。

Method: 基于α-散度的NMF框架，构建含边界因子的更新规则，利用物理化学中能量势垒与Boltzmann概率的理论对迭代过程进行上界/下界分析，推导渐近收敛性证明，并通过生物医学信号与人脸图像聚类实验评估性能。

Conclusion: Chem-NMF通过引入边界因子和基于能垒的理论分析，提供了对多层α-散度NMF收敛性的数学保障，并在实际数据上展示了聚类性能提升。

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

Motivation: 传统流匹配多用于噪声到数据转换，而在通用分布到分布的场景下，源分布也需从有限样本中学习，导致监督稀疏和性能下降，推动研究提出新的训练策略。

Method: 在训练过程中对源样本和流内插点施加扰动（随机噪声与/或采样偏移），以增加监督信号并稳定学习过程，保持计算效率且易于实现。

Conclusion: 该论文提出通过在训练中注入随机扰动来解决流匹配在源分布为有限样本数据时监督稀疏的问题，从而改进分布到分布转换建模。

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

TL;DR: StruSR integrates PINNs-derived local Taylor expansions and attribution-guided genetic operations to improve physics-grounded symbolic regression for PDE systems, leading to faster convergence and more physically consistent interpretable expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression lacks mechanisms to extract structured physical priors from time series, hindering discovery of expressions reflecting global system behavior; leverage PINNs to provide local analytical structure.

Method: Structure-aware symbolic regression using PINNs and genetic programming

Result: Proposed StruSR extracts local Taylor-based structural information from trained PINNs, uses masking-based attribution to score subtrees, guides genetic programming operations, and employs hybrid fitness combining physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch.

Conclusion: StruSR offers a principled paradigm for incorporating PINN-extracted local structure into symbolic discovery, enhancing structural fidelity and interpretability over conventional baselines.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Result: An amortized controller network that augments pretrained ARDMs; trained offline by previewing future rollouts and learning stepwise controls under a terminal cost objective, enabling single forward rollout inference with on-the-fly corrections.

Conclusion: 该方法在多个PDE和观测稀疏度下显著提升稳定性、精度和物理一致性，避免昂贵的伴随或推断时优化，代码将开源。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

TL;DR: 论文研究机器学习算子（MLO）在“零-shot 超分辨率”场景下的表现，发现 MLO 无法在训练分辨率之外进行稳健推断，易受混叠影响。提出一种简单高效的数据驱动多分辨率训练协议，能缓解混叠并实现稳健的多分辨率泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学机器学习中，需要在离散表示下建模连续现象。MLO 被提出以在任意分辨率上推断，但尚不清楚 MLO 是否能在未见过的更高或更低分辨率上进行零-shot 推断，因此评估 MLO 在多分辨率泛化能力的必要性。

Method: 作者把多分辨率推断分解为两种行为：1）对不同频率信息的外推；2）在不同分辨率间的插值。通过一系列实证实验评估 MLO 在零-shot 下的两项能力，发现均表现不佳。为解决问题，提出一种简单、计算高效的数据驱动多分辨率训练协议（可能包含混叠缓解措施如随机低通滤波或多分辨率数据增强）。

Result: 实验证明现有 MLO 在零-shot 超分辨率和下采样任务上失败，表现脆弱且易受混叠影响；所提出的多分辨率训练协议能有效缓解这些问题，提升在不同分辨率上的推断准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MLOs 无法在没有额外训练的情况下实现可靠的零-shot 多分辨率（既超分辨率也下采样）推断，容易受混叠干扰；通过引入数据驱动的多分辨率训练策略，可以显著提升泛化能力和抗混叠性，从而实现稳健的多分辨率推断。

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

Motivation: FF算法只限于监督学习，强化学习中更自然存在学习信号（奖励），但缺乏合适的无反向传播价值估计方法；因此希望将FF思想扩展到RL领域，利用局部goodness函数实现生物可实现的无反向传播RL。

Method: ARQ使用基于层活动统计的goodness函数对状态-动作对进行打分，并通过动作条件化将动作信息融入每层表征；训练采用时序差分目标，局部更新且无需后向传播。

Result: 在MinAtar和DeepMind Control Suite基准上，ARQ在多个任务上优于当前最先进的无反向传播本地RL方法，并在大多数任务上超越使用反向传播训练的算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了基于前向前（Forward-Forward, FF）思想的动作条件化均方根Q函数（ARQ），将FF的局部“goodness”函数与时序差分学习相结合，用于无反向传播的强化学习价值估计。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

Conclusion: GMNM是一种通用、灵活且可训练的模块，能替代或增强传统激活函数，显著提高多种网络的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

Result: 引入广义D-检索任务作为连续函数空间的稠密子类；证明在头数充足时Transformer可高效逼近任意连续函数，而头数不足时需要参数量至少为O(1/ε^{cT})；单头时若嵌入维度O(T)可通过前馈网络完成记忆与逼近；实验在合成与真实任务上验证理论结论。

Conclusion: 注意力头数决定Transformer逼近效率，存在严格的下界表明头不足会导致参数量随误差与序列长度指数增长；单头通过增大嵌入维度可用前馈块实现记忆性逼近。

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有GRPO/GSPO在面對困難提示時探索不足、回饋稀疏且rollout分配上下文無關，導致訓練效率與最終性能受限，因而提出XRPO以系統化地在rollout層面實現探索-利用權衡。

Method: 方法包含：1) 數學化的不確定性驅動rollout分配器，根據每個提示的潛在不確定性動態分配rollout數量；2) in-context seeding，在零回報提示中注入精選示例以啟動探索；3) 群體相對且新穎感知的優勢銳化，利用序列似然性放大低概率正確回答，兼顧探索與利用。

Result: XRPO提出了一個以rollout探索-利用平衡為核心的強化學習框架，針對LLM推理中的探索不足與稀疏回饋問題進行改進。具體貢獻包括：1) 自適應rollout分配器，根據不確定性潛力優先分配資源以提升探索；2) in-context seeding策略，通過注入示例引導模型進入更具挑戰性的推理路徑，避免零回報停滯；3) 群體相對且關注新穎性的優勢強化方法，利用序列似然性放大低概率但正確的回應以強化利用。實驗結果顯示，在數學與編碼基準上，XRPO相較於GRPO和GSPO在pass@1提升最多約4%，cons@32提升最多約6%，並將訓練收斂速度加速最多約2.7倍。

Conclusion: XRPO有效解決了rollout分配固定與稀疏回饋導致的探索不足問題，通過不確定性驅動的資源分配、示例引導和序列似然性驅動的優勢放大，提升了模型在挑戰性提示上的成功率和收斂速度。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

*Zhipeng Liu,Peibo Duan,Xuan Tang,Baixin Li,Yongsheng Huang,Mingyang Geng,Changsheng Zhang,Bin Zhang,Binwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeFormer augments Transformer attention with two temporal modulations (MoSA) reflecting causality and decay, plus multi-scale subsequence modeling, yielding strong forecasting gains over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers designed for text don't capture temporal-specific priors like causality and decaying influence, limiting forecasting performance.

Method: Designs self-attention with two modulation terms (MoSA) constrained by Hawkes process and causal masking; introduces multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture dependencies at different time scales; evaluates on real-world datasets showing significant MSE reduction and broad applicability of MoSA.

Result: Proposes TimeFormer with MoSA (two modulation terms) incorporating unidirectional and decaying influence via Hawkes process and causal masking; adds multi-scale subsequence framework; achieves up to 7.45% MSE reduction and new SOTA on 94.04% metrics; MoSA can enhance other Transformers.

Conclusion: Embedding temporal priors (unidirectional influence, decaying effect) into attention and using multi-scale subsequence analysis improves time series forecasting; MoSA is widely applicable.

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

*Daoyuan Zhou,Xuchuang Wang,Lin Yang,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种在分布式MMAB中基于自适应高效通信协议的算法，通信成本仅O(log log T)，在群体与个体遗憾上接近最优，并扩展到周期性异步场景取得对数级遗憾


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce communication cost while achieving near-optimal group and individual regret in distributed MMAB with collision feedback only

Method: Distributed adaptive communication protocol for MMAB

Result: Algorithm achieves near-optimal group and individual regret with communication cost O(log log T); experiments show significant improvements and reduced individual regret vs SOTA; extended to periodic asynchronous setting with logarithmic regret and proven lower bound

Conclusion: 本方法在低通信代价下实现了接近最优的群体与个体遗憾，并能推广到异步周期性设置，理论与实验均表现优越

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

### [103] [AutoBalance: An Automatic Balancing Framework for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06684)
*Kang An,Chenhao Si,Ming Yan,Shiqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoBalance uses separate adaptive optimizers per loss term and aggregates their updates after preconditioning, improving PINN training and reducing solution errors across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-combine gradient manipulation forces a single optimizer to handle heterogeneous loss landscapes, harming its internal preconditioning; using per-loss adaptive optimizers preserves tailored preconditioning for each component.

Method: AutoBalance: post-combine per-loss optimizers

Result: AutoBalance assigns an adaptive optimizer to each loss term and aggregates preconditioned updates; outperforms existing methods on PDE benchmarks, reducing MSE and L∞ errors and complementing other PINN techniques.

Conclusion: Post-combine optimization with per-loss adaptive optimizers preserves optimizer preconditioning and yields superior PINN performance; compatible with other PINN methods.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

### [104] [A Diffusion Model for Regular Time Series Generation from Irregular Data with Completion and Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06699)
*Gal Fadlon,Idan Arbiv,Nimrod Berman,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 先用Transformer完成缺失值再用基于图像的扩散模型并结合掩码，解决不规则序列生成的邻域“非自然”问题，显著提升判别性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理不规则采样与缺失值时效果或计算成本不佳，图像化扩散模型在规则时间序列上表现优异，但直接掩码填零引入非自然邻域，需新方法融合补全与掩码以保留图像化扩散优势。

Method: 两步：1) 用Time Series Transformer对不规则序列进行补全以恢复自然邻域；2) 将序列转为图像表示，使用视觉扩散模型并配合掩码训练以减少对补全数值的依赖。

Result: Proposes a two-step framework (completion via Time Series Transformer, then vision-based diffusion with masking) to generate irregular time series by creating natural neighborhoods and reducing reliance on imputed values.

Conclusion: 结合序列补全与掩码化的视觉扩散生成能有效处理不规则与缺失值，通过先补全再掩码减少对补全值的依赖，实现更现实且高效的时间序列生成。

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

TL;DR: 提出将状态编码为其到其他所有状态的时间距离（对偶目标表示），理论证明该表示与动力学不变且含有恢复最优策略的充分信息，并能抑制外生噪声；在OGBench 20个任务上实验证明能显著提升离线GCRL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统状态表示可能包含与目标达成无关的冗余或外生噪声，且依赖于具体观测空间。寻求一种对环境动力学不变、只包含达成目标所需信息的通用表示，以提升目标条件强化学习的鲁棒性与性能。

Method: 提出对偶目标表示理论定义，证明其依赖环境内在动力学并能保留足够信息用于恢复最优策略，同时设计实际的表示学习方法并将其与任何现有的GCRL算法结合，进行了OGBench基准的离线实验验证。

Result: 在OGBench的20个任务上（包括状态和像素类型），对偶目标表示在离线目标到达任务中稳定提高了性能，证明了其泛化性与实用性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了“对偶目标表示”用于目标条件强化学习，通过将状态编码为与所有其他状态的时间距离集合，获得与环境动态相关且与原始观测无关的表示。该表示理论上能恢复最优到达策略并滤除外生噪声，且可与现有GCRL算法结合实用化。在OGBench上的20个任务（包含状态与像素输入）上的实验展示了在离线目标到达性能上的一致提升。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出将BED与VaMSL结合的混合因果结构学习与专家先验询问框架，适用于异质域，能生成多模型解释并提高学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往先验询问方法假设单一因果图，不适用于存在潜在子群或异质性的领域；而专家知识在异质域尤为重要，故需针对混合模型设计询问与学习方法。

Method: 基于贝叶斯实验设计（BED）原则，提出一种因果询问策略；并将可微分贝叶斯结构学习（DiBS）扩展为变分混合结构学习（VaMSL），用于迭代推断因果贝叶斯网络（CBN）的混合模型。通过构建包含专家反馈的图先验，在混合CBN推断中使用。

Result: 方法能生成一组备选因果模型（混合成分或簇），在模拟专家指导下于异质合成数据上显著提升结构学习性能，并在乳腺癌数据库上展现捕获复杂分布的能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个针对异质领域的贝叶斯因果结构学习与专家知识询问（elicitation）策略，能够在混合因果图模型下融入专家先验，从而提升结构学习性能。

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

TL;DR: This paper adapts the Forward-Forward algorithm for function regression, demonstrates effectiveness on uni-/multivariate functions, and explores extensions to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and physical neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Forward-Forward (FF) training beyond classification to function regression to leverage FF's suitability for neuromorphic and physical implementations.

Method: Modify FF training to handle continuous function targets by encoding outputs into input-like positive/negative examples or specialized goodness objectives; train and evaluate on various functions; propose architectures/extensions for multivariate cases and physical networks.

Result: Introduces methodology to perform function approximation/regression using the Forward-Forward algorithm; evaluates on univariate and multivariate functions; preliminary extension to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Conclusion: Forward-Forward can be successfully adapted to regression tasks, enabling FF-based function approximators and suggesting applicability to advanced network architectures and physical implementations.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用PINNs将SIR模型与RKI感染数据结合，做出德国各州三年时空尺度的疫情逆问题求解，估计时变参数和R_t，发现传播差异与疫苗接种及疫情阶段相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是COVID-19暴露出需要定量建模以理解真实世界疾病动态，尤其需要后验分析工具评估公共卫生干预（如疫苗和封控政策）的效果，而传统SIR模型难以直接处理带噪观测数据。

Method: 方法上，作者基于Physics-Informed Neural Networks，将SIR模型的常微分方程约束融入神经网络训练中，求解逆问题并从RKI确诊数据中估计时空变化的传染率、恢复率以及随时间变化的有效繁殖数R_t。分析覆盖所有联邦州并进行长期跟踪。

Result: 结果包括：为每个州估计出时变传染率与恢复率，得到R_t曲线并发现不同州间传播行为差异显著；这些差异与疫苗接种率相关联，并能反映主要疫情阶段（如波次、高峰、干预实施与放松）的时序特征；证明PINNs在局部长期流行病建模中的可用性。

Conclusion: 该论文结论是：采用PINNs能有效将SIR模型与真实疫情观测数据结合，实现对德国各联邦州在三年期间的细粒度时空疫情建模与参数反推，并揭示区域间传播差异与疫苗接种率及疫情阶段的相关性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

*Tavish McDonald,Bo Lei,Stanislav Fort,Bhavya Kailkhura,Brian Bartoldson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-time compute improves robustness to adversarial OOD inputs only when base model training makes attacked data components ID-like, enabling compositional generalization; thus combine train-time robustness with test-time specification-centric prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why inference-time compute (reasoning) helps robustness against adversarial OOD data, especially when attackers have gradients or multimodal inputs; reconcile prior negative findings.

Method: empirical+theory

Result: Empirical support across VLMs and attack types: inference-compute helps when compositional generalization allows OOD inputs to be understood via ID components; gains occur for robustified models but not non-robustified ones; RL finetuning and extended reasoning not critical.

Conclusion: Layer train-time robustness (e.g., adversarial pretraining) with test-time inference-compute interventions (prompting to emphasize defensive specs) to achieve synergistic robustness; RICH explains 'rich-get-richer' effect where robustified models benefit more from inference compute.

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

TL;DR: 在OCGL场景下，固定随机编码器+在线训练轻量分类器的极简策略，因保持表征稳定，能够有效减少灾难性遗忘，且在多项基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是OCGL中节点逐个到达且分布漂移不可预知，离线在任务特定子图上训练不可行；传统应对遗忘的复杂重放或正则化方法成本高或效果有限，作者探索更简单稳健的架构是否能减少遗忘。

Method: 方法为：保持图编码器参数固定（随机初始化），仅在线训练一个轻量级分类器；编码器通过聚合邻域信息生成稳健且有表达能力的节点嵌入；不使用记忆缓冲区或复杂重放/正则化机制。

Result: 结果显示在多个OCGL基准上，该简单方法在没有记忆缓冲的情况下仍持续超越最先进方法，性能提升高达30%，且常接近离线联合训练上限。

Conclusion: 论文结论是：在在线持续图学习（OCGL）中，使用固定的、随机初始化的图编码器并只在线训练轻量级分类器，可以显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题，取得比现有复杂方法更好的或接近离线联合训练上限的性能。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

TL;DR: Proposes BitTokens: single-token number encoding using IEEE 754 to make arithmetic efficient for LMs, enabling even small models to nearly perfectly learn basic operations and reduce reasoning token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with efficient numerical computation due to tokenization splitting numbers into multiple tokens and large reasoning chains; need single-token number encodings.

Method: Define desiderata for single-token number encodings; propose BitTokens mapping numbers to single tokens using IEEE 754 binary float bits; conduct experiments showing improved learning of arithmetic by small LMs.

Result: BitTokens: new tokenization embedding numbers as single tokens using IEEE 754 binary representation; experiments show small LMs can learn arithmetic algorithms nearly perfectly, improving efficiency.

Conclusion: BitTokens meet desiderata better than existing methods, significantly improve numerical algorithm learning and efficiency, potentially extending problem length and complexity solvable by LMs.

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive

Motivation: Combine CNN’s local pattern extraction with TFT’s long-range attention to improve multivariate time series forecasting and explainability.

Result: CNN-TFT achieves superior forecasting on hydroelectric natural flow data (MAPE up to 2.2%) and provides explanations via SHAP-MHAW.

Conclusion: CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW在高精度多变量时序预测和可解释性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

TL;DR: 本文用LR、RF、SVM三种机器学习方法对土耳其商业银行和印度尼西亚农村银行数据进行破产预测，RF在商业银行上准确率达约90%，三方法在农村银行上均表现良好，提出机器学习优于传统统计方法以辅助政策制定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计破产预测方法（如Altman Z-Score）依赖刚性假设且可能相关性差，导致预测准确率低，因而需要引入更灵活、性能更高的机器学习方法来提高银行破产预测的准确性，保障金融体系稳定。

Method: 使用三种机器学习方法：逻辑回归（LR）、随机森林（RF）和支持向量机（SVM），分别在两类数据集上训练与测试。商业银行数据来自土耳其1994–2004年的年报（44家在营、21家破产）；农村银行数据来自印度尼西亚2013–2019年的季度报（43家在营、43家破产），并选取5家农村银行做趋势可行性分析。

Result: 实验结果显示：在商业银行数据上，RF模型预测准确率约为90%；在农村银行数据上，LR、RF、SVM均能较好地预测破产概率（具体性能指标未完全披露）。并对五家农村银行进行了破产趋势分析以验证可行性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出基于机器学习的银行破产预测模型，结论为随机森林（RF）在商业银行数据上可达约90%的预测准确率，LR、RF、SVM三种方法在农村银行数据上均能较准确地预测破产概率。研究认为机器学习方法优于传统统计方法，有助于制定降低破产成本的政策。

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

*Olayiwola Arowolo,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HH-MPNN，一种兼顾异构建模与长程依赖的可扩展神经网络，在大规模及拓扑变化下对ACOPF实现高精度（<3%最优性缺口）和显著加速（1000x-10000x）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ACOPF求解器在大规模系统上计算量巨大且求解时间高，现有机器学习方法虽加速但在规模化和拓扑变化时需代价高昂的重训练；因此需要一种可扩展且具有拓扑泛化能力的学习模型。

Method: 提出一种混合异构消息传递神经网络（HH-MPNN），将电网中的不同实体（母线、发电机、负荷、并联电容/电抗、输电线、变压器）分别建模为不同类型的节点或边，并结合可扩展的Transformer模块来处理长程依赖；在14到2000母线的电网上训练和评估；在默认拓扑上训练但在成千上万未见过的拓扑上进行零样本评估；还探索了在小网格上预训练以提升大网格表现。

Result: 在14至2000母线的电网上，HH-MPNN在默认拓扑下的最优性缺口小于1%；在未见过的数千种拓扑的零样本测试中，最优性缺口低于3%；在与内点法求解器比较时，实现了1000倍到10000倍的计算加速；在更大电网上通过在小电网预训练进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的HH-MPNN在解决大规模电网ACOPF问题上表现出色，兼顾了可扩展性和拓扑适应性，具有显著的计算加速优势，对实时电力系统运行具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

*Huahui Yi,Kun Wang,Qiankun Li,Miao Yu,Liang Lin,Gongli Xi,Hao Wu,Xuming Hu,Kang Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SaFeR-VLM embeds safety into multimodal reasoning via RL (dataset, corrective rollouts, structured rewards, GRPO), improving safety significantly—even beating much larger models—while maintaining helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety risks in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) that emerge under adversarial or unsafe prompts, termed the 'Reasoning Tax'. Existing defenses are insufficient as they focus on output-level filtering and do not influence the internal reasoning process. The work seeks to embed safety into the reasoning process via reinforcement learning.

Method: They curate QI-Safe-10K dataset; implement safety-aware rollouts where unsafe outputs are reflected and corrected; design a structured reward model with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations/contradictions; and apply GRPO optimization to reinforce safe and corrected trajectories.

Result: They propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned RL framework consisting of: QI-Safe-10K dataset, safety-aware rollout (reflect-and-correct), structured reward modeling penalizing hallucinations/contradictions, and GRPO optimization reinforcing safe and corrected trajectories. Empirically, SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves safety/helpfulness scores of 70.13 and 78.97, outperforming much larger models; SaFeR-VLM-7B surpasses GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash on safety without loss in helpfulness.

Conclusion: Embedding safety as an active component of the reasoning process via SaFeR-VLM yields robust, scalable, and interpretable safety-aware reasoning that outperforms larger baselines on safety metrics without sacrificing helpfulness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoRE-GNN的异构图自编码器，通过图卷积和注意力机制从原始数据动态构建关系图，用于多组学单细胞数据整合。该方法在六个公共数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在模态间强相关时效果显著，并能用于跨模态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学单细胞数据高维且模态间关系复杂，现有方法难以同时处理数据异构性与跨模态复杂关系，因此需要一种能从数据中自适应构建关系并融合信息的模型。

Method: 构建异构图自编码器，结合图卷积网络（GCN）与注意力机制，动态从数据中构建表示细胞-细胞或特征-特征的关系边（关系图），并通过重构或下游任务训练学习低维表征。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上的实验显示，MoRE-GNN在整合质量和跨模态预测任务上优于基线方法，尤其在模态相关性强的场景提升明显，表征具有生物学可解释性。

Conclusion: MoRE-GNN提供了一种自适应、可扩展且可解释的多组学整合框架，能捕捉生物学相关的跨模态关系并提升下游预测性能，但在复杂数据集上表现存在波动。

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to
high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this,
we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a
heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention
mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.
Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN
captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing
methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations.
Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,
MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing
multi-omics integration.

*Shaojie Zhang,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 作者提出SpherePair，利用角度空间嵌入和几何形式的损失函数来编码成对约束，从而分离表示学习与聚类，提升DCC的可扩展性、泛化性和无需预设聚类数的能力，并有理论保证与实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补现有深度约束聚类在端到端锚点限制和欧氏嵌入判别性不足上的不足，寻求一种在角度空间上自然编码成对约束、提高可扩展性与泛化能力的方法。

Method: 设计SpherePair损失：基于球面/单位向量表示，将必须连约束（must-link）和不能连约束（cannot-link）分别映射为角度相近与角度远离的几何关系；优化网络以使样本在单位球面上按角度聚拢或分离；聚类阶段在角度空间进行，支持无监督推断簇数并对未见样本进行快速嵌入与推断。

Result: 提出了一种名为SpherePair的角度约束嵌入方法，用于深度约束聚类（DCC），通过SpherePair损失在角度空间中忠实编码成对约束，生成聚类友好的嵌入，克服了端到端锚点限制与欧氏嵌入判别性不足的问题。方法支持不指定聚类数、泛化到未见数据、快速推断聚类数并伴随理论保证。实验证明在多个基准上优于现有SOTA方法，具有良好可扩展性和实用性，代码开源。

Conclusion: SpherePair通过在角度空间中保留无冲突的成对关系，能生成对聚类友好的表示，解决了现有DCC方法在锚点依赖与欧氏嵌入上的局限性，具有更好的性能、可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Vacuum Spiker，一种基于脉冲神经网络（SNN）的时序异常检测算法，通过基于全局神经活动变化的新检测准则、Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity的训练方式和高效单脉冲编码，达到在保持竞争性检测性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在时序异常检测上性能强，但能耗高，限制了在物联网、边缘和可穿戴等资源受限环境的部署；因此需要低能耗且仍保持高检测性能的方法。

Method: 方法包括：1）提出基于全局神经活动变化的异常检测准则；2）用修改的STDP训练以使异常发生时神经活动模式发生明显改变；3）提出一种将输入空间离散为不重叠区间并用单个神经元单脉冲编码的高效编码方案；并在多个公开时序异常检测数据集及实际光伏设备数据上进行对比实验。

Conclusion: Vacuum Spiker在公开数据集和实际光伏逆变器案例中表现出竞争性的异常检测性能，并在能耗上大幅优于多种深度学习和传统机器学习基线，适合资源受限设备中的可持续高效异常检测应用。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

Motivation: 评估在自动化机器学习管道生成场景下，LLM在可解释性方面的能力与局限，判断其能否替代或辅助人工工程以产出可解释模型。

Method: 对两个分类任务（驾驶员警觉性二分类与酵母多标签分类），使三款LLM（OpenAI GPT、Anthropic Claude、DeepSeek）自动生成包含四种分类器（随机森林、XGBoost、多层感知机、LSTM）的训练流水线；评估指标包括召回、精确率、F1以及基于SHAP的Average SHAP Fidelity（MSE）和Average SHAP Sparsity（影响特征数）。

Result: 实验表明LLM生成的管道在预测性能上与手工基线接近，并在SHAP忠实度和稀疏性上表现良好，说明LLM可作为自动化可解释ML管道生成的有效工具。

Conclusion: LLMs能够在自动生成ML训练管道时产出具有可解释性的模型，表现出高SHAP忠实度和一致的稀疏性，且性能接近人工设计的基线。

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions.
We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 为解决GAIL在多智能体交通仿真中因不相关交互引发的不稳定，提出将现实性分解为ego-map与ego-neighbor两部分，并辅以社交PPO奖励，显著提升仿真逼真度与训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仿真中，模仿学习方法（行为克隆、GAIL）在多智能体场景下表现差且不稳定，归因于判别器将非关键的邻居间不真实互动误判为ego的不真实行为，导致训练误导。

Method: 在轻量SMART骨干上，设计分解式判别器分别评估ego与地图、ego与邻居的现实性，忽略邻居之间及邻居与地图的交互对ego奖励的干扰；同时引入social PPO，用距离加权的邻居奖励增强整体现实性。

Result: 在WOMD Sim Agents 2025基准上，DecompGAIL在仿真逼真性和稳定性方面达到了SOTA，并在多智能体场景中显著优于传统GAIL与行为克隆方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DecompGAIL通过分解判别器的现实性评估为ego-map和ego-neighbor两部分，并过滤掉误导性的neighbor:neighbor与neighbor:map交互，结合社交PPO奖励，能稳定多智能体GAIL并提高整体交通模拟逼真度。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到将动态链路属性预测模型直接用于节点亲和力预测效果不佳，且简单启发式（如持久预测、移动平均）反而更好，因而需要分析原因并提出专门针对节点亲和力预测的模型和训练方法。

Conclusion: NAViS通过引入虚拟状态并设计针对节点亲和力的损失，有效解决了当前时序图神经网络训练难题，实验表明其在TGB基准上超过了最先进方法和常见启发式基线。

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本工作提出Grouped Differential Attention (GDA)，通过在自注意力头中实行不平衡分配（更多头用于信号提取，较少用于噪声控制）及选择性复制信号头来提高信号保真度与可扩展性，在大规模预训练与持续训练中表现出优于对称基线的泛化与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力在上下文中常分配大量注意力到冗余/噪声信息；先前的Differential Attention虽然区分信号与噪声但要求头数平衡，限制了表示灵活性与可扩展性。为此提出一种更灵活的头分配与扩展方案以提升信号聚焦与扩展效率。

Method: 提出Grouped Differential Attention：将注意力头分为信号保持组和噪声控制组，按不同比例分配头数；对噪声组通过受控重复（类似GQA）稳定其行为；引入group-differentiated growth策略，只扩展（复制）信号组的头以高效扩容。通过大规模预训练和持续训练实验评估不同不平衡比的效果。

Result: 在大规模预训练与持续训练实验中，GDA在中等不平衡比下相比对称基线显示出显著更好的泛化性能和训练稳定性，且仅带来极小的计算开销。

Conclusion: 不平衡头分配与选择性扩展（仅复制信号头）能在计算开销极小的情况下显著提升Transformer的信号聚焦、泛化与训练稳定性，是一种实用且可扩展的架构设计策略。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 有效维度与模型-任务对齐共同决定QNN的训练与性能：无偏时提高有效维度能提升训练与表现，已偏时降低有效维度更有利。张量网络表示为分析工具。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness and realism gaps in Federated Unlearning (FU) by benchmarking existing methods under realistic heterogeneity and proposing a fairness-aware method

Method: Paper analysis and critique

Result: FedCCCU outperforms existing methods under realistic settings; existing methods perform poorly

Conclusion: FedCCCU提供了实用、可扩展的解决方案，能在现实场景下更公平地执行联邦去学习

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

### [127] [From Condensation to Rank Collapse: A Two-Stage Analysis of Transformer Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06954)
*Zheng-An Chen,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: paper provides gradient-flow-based two-stage theory explaining how attention modules escape small initialization via asymmetric perturbations and later undergo condensation and rank collapse, extending classical directional convergence results


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to characterize training dynamics of transformer-based models beyond configuration-specific studies and explain observed benefits of small initialization scales

Method: theoretical analysis of linearized Transformer dynamics

Result: two-stage dynamics: stage 1 - asymmetric weight perturbations maintain non-degenerate gradients allowing escape from small-init regime and matrices condense toward target orientation; stage 2 - key-query matrices engage, normalized matrices move toward asymptotic rank collapse, generalizing directional convergence

Conclusion: linearized transformer training follows a two-stage process: initial asymmetric perturbations enable meaningful gradient dynamics and alignment, followed by active key-query training causing normalized matrices to collapse in rank asymptotically

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

TL;DR: FlexMol: separate 2D/3D encoders with parameter sharing and a decoder to reconstruct missing modality features, enabling multi-stage continuous learning and single-modality inference


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D/3D pretraining needs paired data; unavailable/expensive modality limits applicability

Method: ExplainFlexMol's approach and contributions

Result: FlexMol learns unified representations, supports single-modality inference, outperforms baselines on property prediction, robust to incomplete data

Conclusion: FlexMol enables flexible, robust molecular pretraining without requiring paired modalities and shows superior empirical performance

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.

### [129] [High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06955)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High-rate Mixout (0.9 ViT, 0.8 ResNet) maintains pre-trained knowledge, improves domain generalization, and lowers training cost vs ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization expensive ensembles; dropout over-regularizes pre-trained models; Mixout helps retain prior knowledge.

Method: Apply Mixout with high masking rates (0.9 ViT, 0.8 ResNet) during fine-tuning to swap weights with pre-trained ones; measure compute/memory savings and accuracy on five benchmarks with ResNet/ViT; compare to ensembles.

Result: High-rate Mixout matches ensemble-level OOD accuracy while reducing gradient computation up to 45% and memory up to 90%; optimal high masking rates required.

Conclusion: Using high masking probabilities for Mixout yields strong domain generalization comparable to ensembles and greatly reduces computational and memory costs.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

Motivation: 探索语义信息如何影响学习到的定位表示的性能与鲁棒性，以及在噪声或结构变化下模型是否依赖显著地标而非常见冗余物，从而提升可解释性与可靠性。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习训练定位网络，训练数据包含原始与扰动后的语义地图。训练后进行事后可解释性分析，比较多种解释方法（包括Integrated Gradients、Attention Weights等），并做语义类消融试验以评估各类语义对定位的贡献与权重分配。

Result: 验证了Integrated Gradients与Attention Weights在揭示模型行为方面的可靠性，发现模型倾向于关注语义上显著且区分性的地标，而对频繁出现的对象隐式下权；整体定位在扰动下保持鲁棒并具备可解释性。

Conclusion: 模型在自监督对比语义定位任务中学到对显著语义特征的偏好，能抑制环境噪声并在面对视觉或结构扰动时保持鲁棒，从而实现更可解释的位姿配准。Integrated Gradients与Attention Weights是最可靠的可解释性工具；语义消融揭示对高频对象的隐式下权机制。

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

TL;DR: GMixout refines Mixout by using an EMA anchor and controllable resampling frequency with sparse updates, improving robustness and accuracy under distribution shifts without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness degradation when finetuning vision foundation models by revisiting Mixout and treating it as a weight-sharing implicit ensemble, to control robustness via masking anchor, resampling frequency, mask sparsity.

Method: Analysis of GMixout method

Result: Proposed GMixout: uses EMA anchor and explicit resampling-frequency; sparse-kernel updates small fraction parameters, no inference overhead; improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot and outperforms Model Soups and parameter-efficient finetuning on various benchmarks under distribution shift.

Conclusion: GMixout is an effective, computationally efficient regularizer for finetuning foundation vision models, yielding better robustness across diverse distribution-shift benchmarks.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Method: 设计HTME模块：轻量时序特征提取模块 + 精心设计的多变量特征提取模块，生成多维嵌入并与Transformer结合构成HTMformer

Result: Proposes HTME extractor and HTMformer; shows improved accuracy and efficiency on 8 datasets

Conclusion: 在嵌入层增强多维特征能提升Transformer时序预测性能，HTMformer在多数据集上表现优于基线，同时保持轻量性

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Result: 提出ELMUR，一种带结构化外部记忆的Transformer：每层维护记忆嵌入，通过双向交叉注意力交互，并通过LRU记忆模块使用替换或凸混合更新记忆。ELMUR将有效时域扩展到超出注意力窗口100,000倍，在合成T-Maze任务（最长一百万步）上实现100%成功率，并在POPGym和MIKASA-Robo稀疏奖励视觉操作任务上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 分层、本地化的外部记忆机制提供了一种简单可扩展的方法，能在部分可观测、长时序决策问题中保留并利用远期线索，从而显著改善智能体表现。

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Motivation: enable realistic assessment of LLM agents' ability to perform constrained preference optimization in multi-turn planning tasks like travel planning

Method: benchmark design and evaluation

Result: COMPASS benchmark, travel database for 20 US National Parks, tool ecosystem, evaluation showing acceptable-optimal gap and plan-coordination gap

Conclusion: COMPASS grounds agent evaluation in realistic travel planning, revealing key gaps and driving progress toward agents that better optimize user preferences and coordinate multi-service plans

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EvoIF：一种轻量级方法融合同源MSA轮廓与逆折叠导出的结构-进化约束，解释为MLM的逆强化学习视角，在ProteinGym上用少量数据达到了SOTA级别的突变适应度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实验测定资源有限，相比巨大序列空间数据稀缺；现有蛋白质语言模型在零样本适应度预测上表现优秀，但缺乏统一解释及对跨家族/结构信息的有效利用。作者希望通过解释性框架（IRL）和结合多源进化信号的轻量模型提高预测精度与泛化性，同时降低训练数据和参数需求。

Method: 提出EvoIF：集成两类进化信息——（i）检索到的同源序列生成的MSA轮廓；（ii）通过逆折叠模型得到的跨家族结构-进化约束（inverse folding logits）。将这两类profile与序列-结构表示通过一个紧凑的transition block融合，生成校准概率用于log-odds评分。还提出了理论视角，将MLM视为逆强化学习，pLM的log-odds对应适应度估计。

Result: 在ProteinGym基准（217个突变测定，>2.5M突变体）上，EvoIF及其启用MSA的变体以极少训练数据（仅0.15%）和更少参数实现了最先进或有竞争力的性能。消融实验表明两类profile互补，提升了对不同功能类型、MSA深度、物种和突变深度的稳健性。

Conclusion: EvoIF将进化信号（同源序列的家族内轮廓和基于逆折叠logits的跨家族结构-进化约束）结合进简单轻量的模型，通过过渡模块融合序列-结构表征并输出校准概率，用于log-odds变动打分，从而在蛋白质突变影响预测任务上达到了或接近最先进的性能。

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

*Aryan Golbaghi,Shuo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pre-trained wav2vec2 + efficient HPO (GP-BO/TPE) yields high SER performance quickly on CPUs, outperforming grid search and prior baselines, and improves cross-lingual generalisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine pre-trained speech representations with automated HPO to efficiently improve speech emotion recognition (SER) on commodity CPUs.

Method: Fine-tuned SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base on IEMOCAP as encoder; HPO over 4D search space with 15 trials using GP-BO and TPE (Hyperopt) optimizing BCA on EmoDB; comparisons to grid search and AutoSpeech baseline; cross-lingual evaluation on CREMA-D and RAVDESS.

Result: Using fine-tuned wav2vec2-base encoder and HPO, GP-BO reached 0.96 BCA in 11 min, TPE 0.97 in 15 min on EmoDB; grid search needed much more time. Cross-lingual zero-shot accuracy improved by ~0.25 on CREMA-D and ~0.26 on RAVDESS. Source code released.

Conclusion: Efficient HPO with pre-trained encoders enables competitive, fast SER on commodity hardware; TPE slightly outperforms GP-BO under given budget.

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

*Rushi Qiang,Yuchen Zhuang,Anikait Singh,Percy Liang,Chao Zhang,Sherry Yang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Smith 提出一个多代理自动化流水线，将原始数据集转化为可执行、可验证的机器学习工程（MLE）竞赛式任务，通过生成-验证-执行三阶段提高规模、质量和多样性，已在224个真实数据集上生成606个任务并验证可行性；实验显示 LLM 在这些任务上的表现与人工设计任务高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 MLE 基准依赖静态人工设计数据集，扩展性和适用性受限，且制作成本高，因此需要自动化生成大规模、高质量的 MLE 训练/评测任务方法。

Method: 设计一个多代理流水线（generate-verify-execute）：自动生成结构化任务并标准化重构，采用混合验证（结构规则 + 语义一致性）并通过交互执行验证可解性和真实世界一致性。

Result: 在224个真实世界数据集上生成606个任务，覆盖多种类别、目标和模态；八种主流/前沿 LLM 在这些任务上的性能与其在人工设计任务上的表现高度相关，证明了方法有效性。

Conclusion: MLE-Smith 能在不依赖人工手工设计的情况下，大规模生成高质量、可验证且具多样性的 MLE 任务，且这些自动生成任务的评价能反映 LLM 在人工任务上的能力。

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 用合成长链和仅结果奖励的课程化RL，从短程问题数据高效扩展到长程推理，实验与理论均显示显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服大语言模型在长程推理任务上性能下降的问题，利用现有大量短程数据以可扩展方式提升长程推理能力。

Method: 将短程问题合成为多步依赖链并按难度自动递增编排课程，使用结果-only奖励进行RL训练，避免推理时脚手架和昂贵的逐步监督。

Result: 通过将简单问题合成为任意长度的多步依赖链，使用仅基于最终结果的奖励和自动复杂度递增的课程化RL训练，显著提高了模型在长程推理基准（如GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME）上的准确率，最高提升2.06倍，并在理论上证明课程化RL在样本复杂度上对全程训练有指数级改善。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一条仅用现有短程数据即可高效扩展强化学习到长程问题的可行路径，训练信号接近密集监督且样本效率高。

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

### [144] [Blind Construction of Angular Power Maps in Massive MIMO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07071)
*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised HMM-based method builds angular power maps from unlabeled large-timescale CSI; CRLB shows localization can vanish with uniform rectilinear mobility and Poisson BSs; real data yields ~18m error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce online CSI acquisition overhead in massive MIMO by constructing radio maps without location labels using large-timescale CSI.

Method: Model CSI evolution via hidden Markov model linking mobile trajectory to CSI, estimate location from CSI, construct angular power map; analyze CRLB under different BS spatial distributions; validate on real multi-cell massive MIMO RSRP data.

Result: Develop an unsupervised method using HMM to estimate mobile trajectory and build angular power maps; derive CRLB results for localization under different BS distributions; achieve ~18m average localization error on real RSRP data.

Conclusion: HMM-based unsupervised approach enables radio map construction without location labels; localization performance depends on BS distribution; practical feasibility shown with ~18m error from single-serving-cell data.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

### [145] [Non-Stationary Online Structured Prediction with Surrogate Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07086)
*Shinsaku Sakaue,Han Bao,Yuzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在非平稳环境下，通过将OGD的动态后悔界与替代损失差距结合，给出以比较序列的替代损失F_T与路径长度P_T为主的目标损失上界F_T + C(1+P_T)，并提出了新的Polyak步长与下界证明，结果对T无直接依赖并且紧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平稳环境中，固定比较器的替代损失可能随时间线性增长，导致传统以T无关上界的保证失效，因此需要依赖于比较序列的变化（路径长度）与其累积替代损失来给出更细致的、适应非平稳性的目标损失界。

Method: 核心方法是将在线梯度下降（OGD）的动态后悔（dynamic regret）界与利用替代损失差距（surrogate gap）的技巧结合，构造出以比较序列的替代损失F_T和路径长度P_T为参数的目标损失界。还分析并设计了新的Polyak式学习率，使OGD在目标损失上有保号保证，并将整体方法推广到更广泛的损失族（卷积Fenchel–Young）。

Result: 证明了目标损失有界为F_T + C(1+P_T)；提出并实证验证了新的Polyak式步长对OGD在目标损失上的效果；将方法扩展到卷积Fenchel–Young损失；证明了下界，表明对F_T和P_T的依赖是不可避免且紧的。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在非平稳环境下对在线结构化预测（包含在线分类）的目标损失进行有界分析：证明了累积目标损失可被任何比较序列的累积替代损失F_T与路径长度P_T线性控制，即界为F_T + C(1+P_T)，从而避免对时间地平线T的直接依赖。还给出了适用于OGD的Polyak式步长并推广到卷积Fenchel–Young损失，最后证明此依赖是紧的。

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper gives non-asymptotic efficiency bounds for conformalized quantile and median regression trained by SGD, capturing dependence on training size n, calibration size m, and miscoverage α, with phase transitions and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understand efficiency of conformalized regression when miscoverage α not treated as constant

Method: theoretical analysis

Result: non-asymptotic bounds O(1/√n + 1/(α^2 n) + 1/√m + exp(-α^2 m)) showing dependence on n, m, α; phase transitions in convergence rates; guidance for data allocation

Conclusion: Bounds reveal tradeoffs and phase transitions with α; allocate data considering α to control excess prediction set length; empirical results match theory.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Patrick Peixuan Ye,Chen Shani,Ellen Vitercik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cluster inputs and outputs separately, learn sparse interpretable alignments from few pairs, predict via linked output centroids; simple, model-agnostic, label-efficient


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable semi-supervised learning using unpaired X and Y by leveraging output-only data and interpretable mapping

Method: Bridged Clustering: cluster X and Y, learn sparse bridge with few pairs

Result: Theoretically effective with bounded mis-clustering/mis-bridging; competitive empirically, label-efficient

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering provides a simple, interpretable, and label-efficient semi-supervised method that uses output-only data and sparse bridges to achieve competitive performance under low supervision

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

TL;DR: 投毒攻击所需文档数近乎恒定（约250篇），不随模型或数据规模增加，表明大模型更易被数据投毒植入后门


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模语言模型在预训练和微调阶段对数据投毒攻击的脆弱性，评估所需恶意文档数量随模型与数据规模变化的规律

Method: 在chinchilla-optimal数据规模上训练600M-13B参数模型，注入固定数量的投毒文档（如250篇），并做消融实验（不同投毒比、非随机分布）以及在微调阶段测试投毒效果

Result: 发现所需的恶意文档数量几乎与数据集大小无关；约250份投毒文档可以成功在从600M到13B参数、6B到260Btokens的数据集上植入后门

Conclusion: 注入后门所需的投毒示例数不随模型或训练数据规模线性增加，这使得大模型对数据投毒攻击的风险高于预期，需加强防御研究

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文在Hanin和Sellke的反例基础上，研究了临界宽度w=n与w=n+1下的逼近能力，发现死亡神经元限制了w=n时的逼近，而w=n+1可实现更好逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 补充并细化Hanin和Sellke关于宽度临界的结果：原证明给出必要性时用一个具体反例，但未讨论在临界宽度附近该反例能否被网络逼近。作者研究临界点附近的逼近可行性及深度对逼近能力的影响，揭示深度增加并非总能改善逼近，因死亡神经元限制。

Method: 构造性近似：针对Hanin和Sellke的反例函数，作者在两种宽度（w=n和w=n+1）下用不同深度的ReLU前馈网络构造逼近序列，并分析误差随深度变化。利用网络输出的分段线性结构、单元不激活（dying neurons）现象和参数收敛性来估计误差下界和上界。

Result: 在w=n情况下，随着深度增加，网络的逼近误差不能任意逼近0，存在误差下界并由dying neurons导致；在w=n+1情况下，构造出深度可变的网络序列能以更好的速率逼近目标函数，说明阈值w>n的必要性在实践上对逼近能力有明显影响。

Conclusion: 作者展示了在宽度临界值附近（w=n和w=n+1）可以逼近Hanin和Sellke用于必要性证明的反例函数，但逼近质量受深度影响，且“神经元死亡”现象是主要原因，导致在w=n时逼近变差，而在w=n+1可取得更好逼近。

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管理论上已有关于MoE的分析，多数限于路由器与专家分开优化或仅考虑top-1路由与特殊数据集。本工作旨在提出用于更普适且实际的软路由、非线性组件以及联合训练场景的收敛性与可恢复性理论。

Method: 在学生-教师框架中分析带非线性路由器与专家的软路由MoE，利用过参数化假设证明存在特征学习阶段：先学习路由/专家的特征表示，再通过梯度下降逐步逼近教师参数；此外构建剪枝策略去掉冗余神经元并给出微调过程的收敛证明。

Result: 证明了在中等过参数化条件下，联合训练的学生网络会经历由专家引导的特征学习阶段并能恢复教师参数；训练后通过剪枝能去除冗余，随后微调收敛到全局最优；这是首个针对软路由与非线性模型的联合训练收敛性理论证据。

Conclusion: 在适度过参数化和学生-教师设定下，软路由MoE的联合训练能通过专家引导的特征学习阶段恢复教师参数；结合训练后剪枝与微调，可消除冗余并保证收敛到全局最优，拓展了对MoE优化景观的理论理解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: 本文将Thompson Sampling重构为一个在线优化算法，通过“忠实平稳化”把有限时域动态优化问题转化为与原目标紧密相似的时间不变目标，从而用Bellman原理导出时间不变最优策略，展示Thompson Sampling如何用基于点二列相关的残余不确定性正则化贪婪性来平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Thompson Sampling在实践和理论上表现优良，其如何在内在机制上平衡探索与利用仍不明，作者希望通过新的分析视角解释这一机制，并为算法改进建立原则性框架。

Method: 引入“忠实平稳化”（faithful stationarization）将有限时域问题转换为时间不变目标，基于Bellman原理构建时间不变最优策略，并把Thompson Sampling表述为一种在线优化形式，其中贪婪决策由残余不确定性的正则化项（基于点二列相关）调节。

Result: 得到的结果包括：提出忠实平稳化工具；将Thompson Sampling解释为近似Bellman最优的在线优化算法；识别出基于点二列相关的残余不确定性作为正则化项；由此提供理解和改进Thompson Sampling的新理论基础。

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling可被解释为近似Bellman最优策略的在线优化过程，其通过以点二列相关量度的残余不确定性来正则化即时收益，从而在理论上说明了其探索-利用平衡机制，并为改进该算法提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

TL;DR: 本文分析了交互式学习协议“判别特征反馈”(DFF)的理论性质。作者在可实现与不可实现两种设置下给出DFF的最优错误界，提出用于可实现情况的新维度定义，并在不可实现情况下证明了上界的最优性。结果表明，相比在线学习，DFF中更丰富的反馈使得可实现维度不足以刻画不可实现时的最优错误界或无后悔算法的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索含判别特征解释的交互式反馈（DFF）在学习理论中的基本限制和能力，理解其与经典在线学习的差异，特别是在可实现与不可实现设置下的最优错误界和无后悔性问题。

Method: 在一个与监督学习和在线学习可比的一般框架下形式化DFF协议，定义新的维度概念用于刻画可实现情形的错误界；在不可实现情形中构造算法并证明错误上界，同时给出匹配的下界证明以展示上界的不可改性。

Result: 1) 在可实现设置中，基于新提出的维度给出DFF的错误界刻画；2) 在不可实现设置，提供一个错误上界并证明其在一般情况下不可改进；3) 发现可实现维度不足以刻画不可实现设置下的最优错误界或无后悔性的存在，与在线学习不同。

Conclusion: DFF在理论上与经典在线学习存在显著差异：作者给出了可实现情形下基于新维度的错误界刻画，并在不可实现情形给出不可改进的错误上界，说明可实现维度不能决定不可实现情形下的最优表现或是否存在无后悔算法。

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出一种在推理时基于数据状态图的轻量规划（TTGS），借助状态距离或价值函数导出距离搜索子目标序列，提高离线GCRL在长时序任务中的成功率，无需改动训练或额外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习(GCRL)在长时序决策中因时序赋值与误差累积导致表现差的问题，通过测试时轻量级规划改善策略达成用户指定目标的能力。

Method: 构建以数据集状态为节点、距离或代价为边权的图；对图进行快速路径/子目标搜索以生成可达的子目标序列；用冻结的基于目标的策略逐步执行子目标。若基学习器为基于价值的方法，则直接用学习到的目标值函数导出距离，无需手工度量。

Result: 提出Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS)：在数据集状态上构建加权图，利用任意状态空间距离或由训练的目标值函数导出的距离进行快速搜索，生成子目标序列由已训练且冻结的策略执行。TTGS无需改动训练、额外监督、在线交互或特权信息，完全在推理时运行，并在OGBench基准上提升了多个基学习器在复杂运动任务的成功率。

Conclusion: TTGS证明了简单基于度量的测试时规划能显著缓解离线GCRL的长期决策问题，提高成功率且易于部署。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

### [154] [Dynamic Regret Bounds for Online Omniprediction with Long Term Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07266)
*Yahav Bechavod,Jiuyao Lu,Aaron Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Algorithm for online omniprediction yields per-agent dynamic regret bounds vs changing comparator sequences and vanishing long-term constraint violations; agents need only one-round constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide dynamic regret guarantees for online omniprediction with long-term constraints where learner's predictions are used by multiple downstream decision makers with their own utilities and constraints.

Method: Design an online learning algorithm that produces predictions leading agents to select actions; use techniques to bound dynamic regret against changing comparator sequences and to control cumulative constraint violation, without requiring agent state maintenance.

Result: First algorithm achieving simultaneous dynamic regret guarantees for all agents against changing action sequences while ensuring vanishing constraint violation; agents only solve one-round constrained optimization each round without maintaining state.

Conclusion: We present an algorithm that simultaneously ensures dynamic regret bounds for all downstream agents and vanishing constraint violations, with agents acting myopically via one-round constrained optimizations.

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolGA在下游阶段用分子对齐和条件生成的实例级token把多种分子知识注入预训练2D图编码器，提升十一个数据集的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练2D图编码器虽强但忽略原子/键等子分子实例的丰富领域知识。现有预训练方案通常为特定知识设计目标，缺乏整合多种知识的灵活性。因此在下游阶段高效地复用现有预训练编码器并注入多样知识更实用。

Method: 1) 分子对齐策略：将预训练的拓扑表示与基于领域知识的表示对齐以减少语义差距；2) 条件适配机制：基于输入生成实例特定的token以在节点/边层面精细注入知识；3) 下游微调时仅适配模块与编码器协同工作以提升性能。

Result: MolGA提出一种在下游适配中灵活融合分子领域知识的方法，通过分子对齐策略和条件适配机制将预训练2D图编码器与原子/键级别的领域知识结合。

Conclusion: MolGA可以在不重新训练或修改预训练2D编码器的情况下，通过对齐表示和生成实例特定token，有效整合多样化分子领域知识，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

TL;DR: 提出面向路径规划的语义通信框架，通过定义关键语义并设计收发器，在无线不可靠场景下显著减少传输量且保持路径规划精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中无线通信不稳定导致UAV对UGV提供环境感知信息受限，影响协同路径规划效率与准确性，需减少传输量同时保证关键信息传递。

Method: 定义路径规划关键语义（如环境特征、障碍物位置信息、导航要点），并设计语义编码器、压缩与恢复机制以及适配不可靠信道的收发器。通过仿真比较数据传输量与路径规划精度，验证方法有效性。

Result: The paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom) framework to improve UAV-UGV cooperative path planning under unreliable wireless conditions by transmitting only key semantic information instead of raw data.

Conclusion: 在仿真中，新型语义收发器在保证路径规划准确性的同时，大幅降低数据传输量，提升协同效率，优于传统语义通信收发器。

Abstract: Effective path planning is fundamental to the coordination of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) systems, particularly in
applications such as surveillance, navigation, and emergency response.
Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational
capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task
objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating
hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise
environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy.
However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless
communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it
difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV
coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication
(SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under
unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw
data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing
transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is
developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a
transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning.
Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the
proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while
maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration
efficiency.

Abstract: The primary challenge in autonomous lunar landing missions lies in the
unreliable local control system, which has limited capacity to handle
high-dynamic conditions, severely affecting landing precision and safety.
Recent advancements in lunar satellite communication make it possible to
establish a wireless link between lunar orbit satellites and the lunar lander.
This enables satellites to run high-performance autonomous landing algorithms,
improving landing accuracy while reducing the lander's computational and
storage load. Nevertheless, traditional communication paradigms are not
directly applicable due to significant temperature fluctuations on the lunar
surface, intense solar radiation, and severe interference caused by lunar dust
on hardware. The emerging technique of semantic communication (SemCom) offers
significant advantages in robustness and resource efficiency, particularly
under harsh channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel SemCom
framework for transmitting images from the lander to satellites operating the
remote landing control system. The proposed encoder-decoder dynamically adjusts
the transmission strategy based on real-time feedback from the lander's control
algorithm, ensuring the accurate delivery of critical image features and
enhancing control reliability. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of
the conditions that improve the accuracy of the control algorithm and reduce
end-to-end transmission time under the proposed framework. Simulation results
demonstrate that our SemCom method significantly enhances autonomous landing
performance compared to traditional communication methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多无人机协同任务依赖无线通信，主协调信道易受敌方干扰，传统抗干扰技术已研究较多，但利用智能群体行为（队形控制、定向天线与路由联合优化）来增强抗干扰仍是悬而未决的问题。

Method: 提出将遗传算法作为联合优化框架，个体编码包含队形参数、天线波束方向和路由策略，适应度函数综合评估在被干扰情形下的通信成功率、链路质量和协作效率。仿真评估在存在干扰的主协调信道与低速率冗余管理信道假设下进行。

Conclusion: 使用遗传算法同时优化无人机集群队形、波束转向天线和流量路由，可以在对主协调信道遭受干扰时提高群体通信的鲁棒性，但计算成本显著，需要进一步优化以实现实时部署。

Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true
revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when
operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing
the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given
task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with
situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless
communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to
disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes
the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well
covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to
leverage those techniques is still an open research issue.
  This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize
UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to
mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the
assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation
management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed
approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further
research.

TL;DR: DiLi是一种支持在线动态分区与跨机器负载均衡的条件无锁、线性化链表，查询通过二分分区索引加有限线性遍历实现，单机性能不减，多机吞吐线性扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对单机吞吐瓶颈和避免静态分区带来的负载不均及停机重分区问题，设计一个可动态分区且可跨机器分布的无锁并发搜索结构，以支持在线扩展与负载均衡。

Method: 在锁自由链表基础上引入条件无锁概念，设计了用于动态分区与子链表迁移的原语，查询通过先对分区索引进行二分查找定位子链表，再在该子链表上做有限长度的线性遍历；维护线性化与条件无锁性以允许异步迁移与分布部署。

Result: 实验表明DiLi在单机上性能与基于链表的最先进无锁并发搜索结构相当；在多机部署时，吞吐量随机器数目近线性扩展，证明了其可分布性与可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DiLi，一种在分布式环境下保持条件无锁、线性化且可动态分区和负载均衡的链表数据结构，通过对分区方案的二分查找加上限长线性遍历实现高效查找，支持find/insert/remove，并在单机上匹配最先进无锁链表性能，在多机上吞吐随机器数线性扩展。

Abstract: Modern databases use dynamic search structures that store a huge amount of
data, and often serve them using multi-threaded algorithms to support the
ever-increasing throughput needs. When this throughput need exceeds the
capacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the
underlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a
long down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of
the data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven
load distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later
will require downtime.
  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication
support from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion
of conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation
with reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present
DiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that
can be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists
and (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi
contains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the
underlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as
the client operations.
  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary
search on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable
number of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi
performs as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures
that are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine. We also
show that the throughput of DiLi scales linearly with the number of machines
that host it.

Abstract: Computational protein design is experiencing a transformation driven by
AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is
astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving
convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial
computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for
Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing
systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed,
as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models.
This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and
implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting
computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of
protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic
resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.

Conclusion: 提出并解决了在完全复制、弱一致性分布式数据库中进行检查点问题（DTCS），定义了size-minimal checkpointing并给出仅需O(n)消息和一个计数器的最小开销算法，能在弱一致性环境下产生强一致的快照序列，从而方便在出现异常时只关注相关快照。

Abstract: We focus on the problem of checkpointing in fully replicated weakly
consistent distributed databases, which we refer to as Distributed Transaction
Consistent Snapshot (DTCS). A typical example of such a system is a main-memory
database that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important
and challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates
anomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to
ascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2)
traditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By
showing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive
overhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully
replicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal
checkpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter
for existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing
checkpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.
  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of
snapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation
is weakly consistent. In essence, when anomalies arise in an eventually
consistent system, DTCS enables one to concentrate solely on the snapshots
surrounding the time point of the anomaly.

Method: 提出基于强化学习的实时重调度算法 REACH，在线观测资源与性能变化并决定微服务迁移/重部署以优化延迟。

Result: 在真实测试平台上对三种基准微服务应用的实验显示，REACH 将平均端到端延迟分别降低约7.9%、10%和8%，并有效减少延迟波动与峰值。

Conclusion: REACH 能在云-边缘连续体中通过强化学习动态调整微服务部署，从而在动态异构资源环境下降低端到端延迟并减小延迟抖动。

Abstract: Cloud computing, despite its advantages in scalability, may not always fully
satisfy the low-latency demands of emerging latency-sensitive pervasive
applications. The cloud-edge continuum addresses this by integrating the
responsiveness of edge resources with cloud scalability. Microservice
Architecture (MSA) characterized by modular, loosely coupled services, aligns
effectively with this continuum. However, the heterogeneous and dynamic
computing resource poses significant challenges to the optimal placement of
microservices. We propose REACH, a novel rescheduling algorithm that
dynamically adapts microservice placement in real time using reinforcement
learning to react to fluctuating resource availability, and performance
variations across distributed infrastructures. Extensive experiments on a
real-world testbed demonstrate that REACH reduces average end-to-end latency by
7.9%, 10%, and 8% across three benchmark MSA applications, while effectively
mitigating latency fluctuations and spikes.

TL;DR: MUDAP provides multi-dimensional vertical scaling on Edge devices; RASK learns a continuous regression model fast to select scaling actions, outperforming Kubernetes VPA and RL by reducing SLO violations by 28% when adding elasticity dimensions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices have limited resources; stream processing services may miss SLOs; existing autoscalers only scale resources, lacking alternative adjustments

Method: Design of MUDAP enabling service-specific scaling (e.g., data quality, model size), and a scaling agent RASK that explores solution space and learns continuous regression model; experimental comparison with VPA and RL on single Edge device with up to 9 services

Result: Introduces MUDAP for fine-grained vertical scaling across service- and resource-level dimensions; presents RASK agent (Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge) to learn regression model for inferring optimal scaling actions; compared to Kubernetes VPA and RL agent on up to 9 services, RASK learns accurate model in 20 iterations (~200s) and reduces SLO violations by 28% while sustaining highest load

Conclusion: RASK within MUDAP efficiently learns environment model and applies multi-dimensional scaling to better sustain SLOs on Edge devices, outperforming baselines in load and SLO adherence

Abstract: Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations
where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing
autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require
alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing
services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling
Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both
service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling
tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a
particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a
scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The
RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous
regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling
actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and
a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge
device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in
merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding
elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less
SLO violations, compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 选择GPU应根据模拟体系规模和功耗预算权衡：小体系优先选择频率高的卡，大体系优先选择内存带宽强的卡；在有功率限制时，A100等高端卡更能维持性能。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational
biophysics, but their performance depend heavily on hardware choices and
configuration. In this work, we presents a comprehensive performance analysis
of four NVIDIA GPU accelerators -- A40, A100, L4, and L40 -- using six
representative GROMACS biomolecular workloads alongside two synthetic
benchmarks: Pi Solver (compute bound) and STREAM Triad (memory bound). We
investigate how performance scales with GPU graphics clock frequency and how
workloads respond to power capping. The two synthetic benchmarks define the
extremes of frequency scaling: Pi Solver shows ideal compute scalability, while
STREAM Triad reveals memory bandwidth limits -- framing GROMACS's performance
in context. Our results reveal distinct frequency scaling behaviors: Smaller
GROMACS systems exhibit strong frequency sensitivity, while larger systems
saturate quickly, becoming increasingly memory bound. Under power capping,
performance remains stable until architecture- and workload-specific thresholds

performance even under reduced power budgets. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting GPU hardware and optimizing GROMACS performance for
large-scale MD workflows under power constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个用于异构系统（CPU、GPU、FPGA）的评估框架，通过抽象任务图驱动真实运行以收集 makespan 数据，并评估现有解析模型的预测能力，分析数据传输开销与设备拥塞等高层挑战。

Motivation: 在异构系统中，如何将任务映射到加速器以优化 makespan 是关键且困难的问题；模拟器实现代价高、解析模型又过于抽象，故需要一个介于二者之间、能快速评估并反映真实系统特性的工具。

Method: 设计并实现一个高度灵活的评估框架，用抽象任务图描述应用行为，在真实异构硬件（CPU/GPU/FPGA）上生成并执行相应任务以测量 makespan，随后用现有解析模型预测对比，分析误差来源。

Result: 构建的框架能收集真实 makespan，实验表明解析模型在忽略数据传输和设备拥塞时会系统性低估或错误估计 makespan；文中列出了若干典型挑战并讨论改进方向。

Conclusion: 基于抽象任务图的真实测量框架能为 makespan 预测提供有价值的基准；现有解析方法在一定条件下可用，但在处理数据传输与设备拥塞等高层次影响时存在明显误差，需更复杂或经验校准的模型。

Abstract: Heterogeneous computing systems, which combine general-purpose processors
with specialized accelerators, are increasingly important for optimizing the
performance of modern applications. A central challenge is to decide which
parts of an application should be executed on which accelerator or, more
generally, how to map the tasks of an application to available devices.
Predicting the impact of a change in a task mapping on the overall makespan is
non-trivial. While there are very capable simulators, these generally require a
full implementation of the tasks in question, which is particularly
time-intensive for programmable logic. A promising alternative is to use a
purely analytical function, which allows for very fast predictions, but
abstracts significantly from reality. Bridging the gap between theory and
practice poses a significant challenge to algorithm developers. This paper aims
to aid in the development of rapid makespan prediction algorithms by providing
a highly flexible evaluation framework for heterogeneous systems consisting of
CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, which is capable of collecting real-world makespan
results based on abstract task graph descriptions. We analyze to what extent
actual makespans can be predicted by existing analytical approaches.
Furthermore, we present common challenges that arise from high-level
characteristics such as data transfer overhead and device congestion in
heterogeneous systems.
