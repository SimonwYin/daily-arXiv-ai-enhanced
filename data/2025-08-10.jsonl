To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an\ninnovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose\nnatural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources\nacross multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.\nFirst, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that\nautomatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational\nand semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by\nutilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic\ncross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a\nsmart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.\nSecond, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic\nplans effectively.

Differential privacy provides a\nrigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling\nmeaningful statistical analysis.

Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the\nrelationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers\nor heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to\nthe non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type\ntransformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary\nleast squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private\nestimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal\nstatistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees.

In this work, we revisit the core objective\nof explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is\nrecommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a\ncomprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets,\nwe identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model\npredictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly\nrepetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a\nlightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature\nattribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces\nfaithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual\ndecision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not\nonly achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly\nimproves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment,\nstructure, and faithfulness. This work highlights the need to move beyond the\nreview-as-explanation paradigm and toward explanation methods that are both\naccountable and interpretable."}

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation."}

Our work theoretically demonstrates\nwhy treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in\nsurvival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,\ncritically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of\nmisclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in\nsurvival estimates.

However, this\narchitecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of\nfailure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or\nvulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in\ncentralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be\nunreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and\noffer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,\npeer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P\ntopology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of\ntrustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided\nAggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement\nThrough Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an\nagreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the\nsemantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to\nthe clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored\nsubset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that\nfurther stabilizes the training.
