### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF方法通过随机过滤与类别相关性较低的图像块，专注于关键食物特征，显著提升了少样本学习在复杂食物图像上的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性导致少样本学习模型在比较查询和支持图像时容易失去对关键元素的关注，从而造成误分类。

Method: 提出SPFF方法，通过随机过滤与类别表示相关性较低的图像块嵌入，利用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256等基准测试中，SPFF优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF通过聚焦于类别特定的关键特征，有效提升了少样本学习在食物图像分类中的性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3是一种自监督学习模型，通过数据扩展和新方法Gram anchoring提升性能，适用于多种视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习无需手动标注数据，有望从多样化数据中学习通用视觉表示。

Method: 采用数据扩展和优化、Gram anchoring方法解决特征退化问题，并应用后处理策略增强模型灵活性。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务中表现优异，超越现有自监督和弱监督模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了自监督学习的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态学习方法，用于提供变形攻击检测的文本描述，通过CLIP零样本评估展示了其通用性和文本预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是人脸识别系统中确保可靠验证的关键组成部分，需要一种能够提供可理解文本描述的方法。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，设计了十种不同文本提示，并结合SOTA预训练神经网络进行评估。

Result: 在五种不同变形生成技术和三种不同媒介的数据集上展示了框架的通用性和文本预测能力。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法忽视了甲骨文字形与语义的复杂联系，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，并设计了部首-象形双重匹配机制。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得了Top-10准确率和卓越的零样本破译能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了逻辑分析过程，可能为未破译甲骨文提供考古学参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于全身双能X射线吸收测量（TBDXA）扫描，并在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA是一种低成本的全身体成像技术，广泛用于身体成分评估，但缺乏自动化的关键点标记方法。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描训练和验证深度学习模型，用于自动放置关键点。

Result: 在外部测试数据集中，模型的关键点正确率达到99.5%，并成功应用于35,928次扫描的形状和外观建模（SAM）。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅验证了现有健康标记物的关联性，还生成了关于身体成分与健康关系的新假设，相关代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO是一种新型多模态融合方法，通过可逆交叉注意力层和三种新机制显式学习多模态特征，实验证明其在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，难以显式学习多模态特征的本质相关性，导致模型无法充分理解复杂结构和关联。

Method: 提出了一种基于可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）的归一化流模型，并设计了三种新的交叉注意力机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA）来捕捉多模态数据中的复杂相关性。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类三个任务中，MANGO方法均表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法在多模态学习任务中表现出色，通过引入可逆交叉注意力层和新的交叉注意力机制，显著提升了模型性能，并在多个任务中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，结合少量真实图像与大量合成图像可以显著提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，优于仅使用真实或合成图像的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏对真实与合成图像结合效果的评估，尤其是在农业病害分类领域。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，通过五种不同比例的真实与合成图像组合（H0-H4）进行训练，并采用微调和迁移学习技术。

Result: H3和H4（1:10真实与合成图像比例）的模型表现最佳，F1分数从0.65提升至1.00。

Conclusion: 合成图像不能完全替代真实图像，但两者结合可以显著提升模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能，解决了真实数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和事件罕见性，工业泄漏检测等领域缺乏真实数据，导致传统微调方法难以应用。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，提升VLMs和目标检测器（如YOLO和DETR）的性能。

Result: 合成数据（SynSpill数据集）显著提升了VLMs和检测器的性能，使其在未见泄漏场景中表现更优且性能接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺问题的有效手段，结合轻量级适配方法，为工业环境中的视觉系统部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntropyGS 是一种针对 3DGS 高斯属性的高效熵编码方法，显著降低存储需求并保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS 的高斯创建和视图渲染任务通常在不同时间或设备上分离，因此需要压缩高斯属性以减少存储和传输需求。

Method: 通过分析 3DGS 高斯属性的统计特性，提出了一种基于分布参数估计的自适应熵编码方法。

Result: EntropyGS 在基准数据集上实现了约 30 倍的压缩率，同时保持相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS 提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法，显著降低了 3DGS 高斯属性的存储和传输需求，同时保持了渲染质量。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Motivation: 尽管组织学图像提供了丰富的形态学信息，但如何从中提取稳健的细胞级特征并与空间转录组数据整合仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: CellSymphony利用基础模型从Xenium转录组数据和组织学图像中提取嵌入，学习融合空间基因表达和形态学背景的联合表征。

Result: CellSymphony在三种癌症类型中实现了精确的细胞类型注释，并揭示了不同的微环境生态位。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基础模型和多模态融合在解析复杂组织生态系统中细胞生理和表型调控方面的潜力。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过建模区域间一致性来减少LVLMs中的幻觉现象，显著提高了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但常因无法验证图像不同区域的信息而产生与视觉输入不一致的幻觉文本。

Method: 提出Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD)，利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，并通过Jensen-Shannon Divergence计算可靠性权重，最后进行一致性融合。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少了幻觉现象，提高了响应的事实准确性，且无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD通过区域间一致性建模，有效提升了LVLMs的事实基础，为多模态任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

TL;DR: DARC 是一种新型模型驱动的群体配准框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，支持高效图谱构建及其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖大规模训练数据且泛化性差，而模型驱动方法虽数据高效但面临可扩展性和优化挑战。DARC 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DARC 是一种基于模型驱动的群体配准框架，采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，支持多种图像相似性度量，并能高效处理任意数量的 3D 图像。

Result: DARC 能够生成无偏且具有高解剖保真度的微分同胚图谱，并在一次性分割和形状合成应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: DARC 提供了一个灵活、通用且资源高效的框架，适用于图谱构建及其应用，如一次性分割和形状合成。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种动态校准策略，通过在校准过程中引入头部姿态变化，提高了PoG估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PoG估计方法在个体间泛化能力差，且对头部姿态变化敏感，因此需要研究更鲁棒的校准策略。

Method: 构建了MobilePoG基准数据集，并系统分析了校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响。提出了一种动态校准策略，用户在移动手机时注视校准点。

Result: 实验表明，在校准过程中引入更广泛的头部姿态可以提高估计器对姿态变化的处理能力。动态校准策略比传统方法更有效。

Conclusion: 通过动态校准策略，研究提出了一种更鲁棒的PoG估计方法，能够有效减少头部姿态变化对估计精度的影响。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG

Motivation: 现有文本驱动图像生成方法在语义对齐准确性和结构一致性方面存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过引入对比学习模块和结构先验（如语义布局图或边缘草图），结合多目标监督机制，优化对比损失、结构一致性损失和语义保留损失。

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 花样滑冰跳跃动作识别需要专家知识，现有TAS方法数据不足且未考虑动作的三维特性和程序结构。

Method: 提出了一种结合视图不变对比预训练和动作分类微调的新TAS框架（VIFSS），并构建了首个公开的3D姿态数据集FS-Jump3D。

Result: 方法在元素级TAS任务中F1@50超过92%，视图不变对比预训练在数据有限时效果显著。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的新TAS框架在花样滑冰跳跃动作识别中表现出色，F1@50达到92%以上，尤其在数据有限的情况下，视图不变对比预训练效果显著。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCWLAD是一种改进的多模态光学图像匹配方法，通过粗匹配和精细匹配步骤，显著提高了匹配精度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配的准确性通常因不同光谱响应引起的非线性辐射和几何变形差异而降低。

Method: PCWLAD方法包括两个主要步骤：使用SSIM进行粗匹配和使用WLAD进行精细匹配。在粗匹配步骤中，计算相位一致性（PC）以保留原始结构细节；在精细匹配步骤中，应用辐射和几何变换模型，并使用WLAD准则估计亚像素偏移。

Result: PCWLAD在正确匹配率（CMR）和均方根误差（RMSE）方面优于现有的八种先进方法，平均匹配精度约为0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在三种数据集上均表现出色，平均匹配精度约为0.4像素，优于现有的八种先进方法。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人及多人动态分开处理，而InterSyn旨在捕捉真实场景中的自然动态交互和协调。

Method: InterSyn包含两个模块：INS（联合建模单人及交互行为）和REC（优化角色间的动态协调）。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本对齐性和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然动作合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码以促进研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: OoD分割在安全关键应用中至关重要，未来研究应关注提升分割精度和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: 论文总结了强化学习与生成模型交叉领域的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to co-generate images and intrinsic scene properties improves spatial consistency in image generation without degrading quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about underlying structures and layouts. Leveraging intrinsic scene properties can address this issue.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) from a large dataset using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable via an autoencoder, and jointly denoises image and intrinsic domains with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs).

Result: Experimental results show the method corrects spatial inconsistencies, produces more natural scene layouts, and maintains the base model's fidelity and textual alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves spatial consistency and realism in image generation by co-generating images and their corresponding intrinsic scene properties, maintaining fidelity and textual alignment.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中的隐式标签噪声（如模糊对象边界和标注者差异）会损害模型性能，而传统数据增强方法可能放大这些噪声。

Method: 通过仅对分割标签施加弹性变形而保持原始图像不变，NSegment+ 鼓励模型学习对标签不一致性具有鲁棒性的表示。

Result: 在多个数据集（Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes、PASCAL VOC）上平均 mIoU 提升显著，最高达 +3.39。

Conclusion: NSegment+ 有效解决了隐式标签噪声问题，且与其他训练技巧结合时效果更佳。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [30] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过修改文本嵌入空间中的delta向量来抑制扩散模型中与特定词强关联的内容，显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I扩散模型在生成图像时难以抑制与特定词强关联的内容（如‘Charlie Chaplin’与‘mustache’的关联），需要一种更有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入delta向量修改文本嵌入，削弱不想要内容的影响，并提出了选择性抑制方法（SSDV）优化跨注意力机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法，并能更精确地抑制个性化T2I模型中的不想要内容。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了T2I扩散模型中内容抑制的难题，为生成更符合用户需求的图像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过自适应融合坡度特征和时间一致性模块，显著提升了高度估计和车道检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，因此需要一种更鲁棒的自适应方法。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score达到SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过自适应坡度特征和时间一致性模块，为3D车道检测提供了更准确和稳定的高度估计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: NanoControl是一种高效的DiT可控文本到图像生成模型，通过LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT可控生成方法依赖ControlNet范式，导致参数和计算成本高。

Method: 采用Flux作为主干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制。

Result: 仅增加0.024%参数和0.029%GFLOPs，实现高效可控生成。

Conclusion: NanoControl在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升效率和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个大规模视觉问答数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空推理，显著提升了视觉语言模型在动态交通场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于静态图像文本对训练，难以满足动态交通场景的精确时空推理需求。

Method: 利用东京100小时多传感器驾驶数据构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含1600万QA对和285K帧，支持对象中心和自我中心推理。

Result: 微调后的视觉语言模型在空间定位和未来运动预测中分别达到55%和28%的准确率，显著优于通用模型。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Motivation: 持续视频实例分割需要在吸收新类别的同时保持旧类别的稳定性，并确保时间一致性。现有方法在实例级、类别级和任务级存在混淆问题。

Method: CRISP通过实例跟踪建模、自适应残差语义提示学习框架和对比学习损失，分别解决实例级、类别级和任务级的混淆问题。

Conclusion: CRISP通过创新的残差注入和语义提示机制，有效解决了持续视频实例分割中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Motivation: 现有方法需要双模态标注，导致标注成本高，因此提出一种仅需单模态标注的框架。

Method: 提出了基于单-双模态协作师生网络（CoSD-TSNet）的DOD-SA框架，包括单模态分支（SM-Branch）和双模态解耦分支（DMD-Branch），并采用渐进式自调优训练策略（PaST）和伪标签分配器（PLA）。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA框架通过单模态标注实现了红外-可见光目标检测的高效训练，显著降低了标注成本，并在DroneVehicle数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手工解读扫描的电气布局图耗时且容易出错，缺乏机器可读性，限制了建筑行业的工作流程效率。

Method: 使用预训练的物体检测模型（如YOLOv8）在DELP数据集上进行系统评估，开发了轻量级开源工具SkeySpot。

Result: YOLOv8在DELP数据集上达到了82.5%的平均精度（mAP），SkeySpot能够实时检测、分类和量化电气符号。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了建筑行业中小企业对专有CAD系统的依赖，支持标准化、互操作性和可持续性目标。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Result: V1-like层在图像失真任务中与人类感知判断相关性最高，且在中度噪声、模糊和稀疏条件下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真水平和稀疏性进行优化，生物启发模型可在无监督下学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

TL;DR: TS-Mamba 是一种高效的在线视频超分辨率方法，通过轨迹感知的 Shifted SSMs 实现长程建模和低复杂度计算，性能优于现有基准模型。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的在线视频超分辨率方法通常仅使用一个相邻的先前帧进行时间对齐，限制了长程时间建模。状态空间模型 (SSMs) 具有线性计算复杂度和全局感受野，能够显著提高计算效率和性能。

Method: TS-Mamba 首先构建视频中的轨迹以选择最相似的 token，然后使用 Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) 模块进行聚合。该模块基于 Hilbert 扫描和移位操作设计，以补偿扫描损失并增强空间连续性。此外，还提出了轨迹感知损失函数来监督轨迹生成。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的 VSR 测试数据集上的实验表明，TS-Mamba 在大多数情况下优于六个基准模型，并减少了 22.7% 的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba 是一种基于轨迹感知的 Shifted SSMs 的在线视频超分辨率方法，通过长程轨迹建模和低复杂度 Mamba 实现了高效的时空信息聚合，在大多数情况下达到了最先进的性能，并减少了 22.7% 的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Motivation: 手动标记体积图像（如脑MRI）耗时费力，现有领域随机化技术在标记数据极少时解剖变异性有限，自训练方法通过伪标签利用未标记数据，但伪标签质量是关键。

Method: 1. 自动分箱体素强度生成合成图像训练初始模型；2. 用卷积自动编码器（AE）评估伪标签质量；3. 选择高质量伪标签微调网络。

Conclusion: 领域随机化与AE质量控制的结合为极有限标记数据的半监督分割提供了有效策略，可减轻新解剖结构或成像技术研究中的标记负担。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS诊断在肺腺癌中具有挑战性，需要高效准确的深度学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种多模式注意力感知的多实例学习框架（STAMP），包括双分支架构、基于Transformer的实例编码和多模式注意力聚合模块。

Result: STAMP在STAS-SXY、STAS-TXY和STAS-TCGA数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928。

Conclusion: STAMP模型在多中心数据集上表现出色，诊断结果超过临床水平，为STAS诊断提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit是一种无需调优和反转的图像编辑框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径，显著提升语义保留和目标对齐效率，仅需12步即可完成编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像编辑中过度依赖目标提示，导致源图像语义保留不足且编辑路径过长。

Method: 提出TweezeEdit框架，通过梯度驱动的正则化，直接在一致性模型上注入目标提示语义，避免依赖反转锚点。

Result: 实验表明，TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，且编辑速度极快（1.6秒/次）。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit为实时图像编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的细节保留性能，特别是在高频纹理和尖锐不连续区域，同时保持了实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的综合优化框架通过结合多重采样抗锯齿（MSAA）和双重几何约束，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅技术在细节保留和高频纹理重建方面的性能，同时保持了实时渲染效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Conclusion: 视觉推理的未来研究方向包括构建透明、可信赖且跨领域适应的AI系统，特别是在自动驾驶和医疗诊断等关键领域。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP-5M和Med-GLIP为医学图像定位提供了统一且可推广的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中显著目标检测面临目标尺度变化大和目标与背景对比度低的挑战，现有方法难以有效整合全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCRPNet在显著目标检测任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过结合长程依赖和局部特征增强，有效解决了遥感图像中显著目标检测的难题。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新的特征学习和蒸馏方法，有效解决了多数据集训练中的挑战，提升了疾病筛查的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Conclusion: AR工具追踪导航系统在外科手术中具有潜力，尤其是在需要高精度的场景中。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAP的新方法，通过检索外部知识增强预训练视觉语言模型的提示，提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法因依赖有限且不匹配的异常样本，导致语义监督不足，性能不佳。

Method: RAP在训练时检索外部文本知识中的描述性词汇增强OOD提示，测试时动态更新提示以适应测试环境。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP将FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提高1.71%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAP通过动态检索增强提示，显著提升OOD检测性能，实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Motivation: 解决PTQ导致性能下降和QAT计算开销大的问题，提出一种高效且通用的量化方法。

Method: 选择关键层进行QAT微调，其余层采用PTQ，优化量化误差传播而非局部误差。

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于QAT基线，量化精度提升且计算开销减少。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖隐式建模音频-面部运动关联，缺乏明确的发音先验，导致视频中出现运动模糊和唇部抖动。

Result: 实验表明，HM-Talker 在视觉质量和唇同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HM-Talker 通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成质量，适用于多样化身份。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: SpaRC-AD展示了雷达融合在安全关键场景中的有效性，特别是在精确运动理解和长时程轨迹预测方面，有助于避免碰撞。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算复杂度高且缺乏灵活性，而现有基于基础模型的方法依赖固定流程，无法适应动态任务需求。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成动态工作流，结合多模态专用工具进行迭代交互，以识别目标对象。

Result: 在RVOS和Ref-AVS任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-Modal Agent通过动态工作流和LLM的推理能力，显著提升了在RVOS和Ref-AVS任务上的性能，展示了其灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: HumanSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在人类中心场景中感知和交互能力的基准测试，揭示了现有模型的不足，并提出通过多阶段强化学习和推理能力提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架缺乏对人类复杂意图和情感响应的细粒度评估，阻碍了MLLMs在人类中心场景中的进展。

Method: 提出HumanSense基准测试，结合多模态输入（视觉、音频、文本），并采用多阶段、模态渐进强化学习提升Omni模型的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，补充音频和文本信息显著提升性能，Omni模型在交互任务中表现更优；推理能力是提供适当反馈的关键。

Conclusion: HumanSense为MLLMs在人类中心场景中的评估提供了新标准，推理能力和多模态信息融合是未来改进方向。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致的图像质量下降对计算机视觉任务构成挑战，现有方法难以处理其高度不适定性。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件的两步网络：首先利用事件积分减少模糊，然后通过方差图消除倾斜失真。

Result: EvTurb在性能上超越了现有方法，并展示了首个真实捕获的湍流数据集TurbEvent。

Conclusion: EvTurb通过事件流成功解耦了湍流引起的模糊和倾斜效应，并在计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法在自动驾驶场景中因评价指标和低分辨率数据限制，攻击效果被高估且实用性不足。

Method: 提出PASR指标和LCSL损失函数，并引入PSPP数据预处理步骤，优化高分辨率数据集上的攻击效果。

Result: P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: P$^3$A通过更准确的评价指标和优化方法，显著提升了对抗补丁攻击的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

TL;DR: FGA是一种轻量级上采样模块，通过傅里叶特征、相关注意力层和频域损失，显著提升超分辨率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法效率高但难以重建高频细节并易引入混叠伪影。

Method: FGA结合傅里叶特征MLP、跨分辨率相关注意力层和频域L1损失。

Result: 在五种超分辨率骨干网络上平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提高29%。

Conclusion: FGA在减少混叠和保留细节方面表现优异，是传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属伪影在 CT 成像中严重影响图像质量，现有深度学习方法在抑制伪影和保留结构细节之间存在挑战。

Method: FIND-Net 结合了快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练的高斯滤波，将 MAR 视为频域和空间域的混合任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net 在 MAE、SSIM 和 PSNR 上均优于现有方法；在真实临床 CT 扫描中也表现出色。

Conclusion: FIND-Net 通过结合频域和空间域处理，显著提升了金属伪影减少（MAR）的性能，同时保持了结构细节，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前条件图像生成模型在提高生成质量的同时牺牲了多样性，限制了其作为合成训练数据的实用性。

Method: 提出 Chamfer Guidance，利用少量真实样本图像来表征合成数据的质量和多样性，无需训练即可实现。

Result: 在 ImageNet-1k 和地理多样性基准测试中，Chamfer Guidance 在保持或提高生成质量的同时显著提升了多样性，并在少样本任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance 是一种无需训练的引导方法，通过少量真实样本图像提升生成数据的多样性和质量，显著提高了下游任务的性能，并在计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像和传感器数据，用于环境监测和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标题，缺乏交互式场景推理。

Method: 创建包含177k图像的数据集，使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注，并利用LoRA适配器微调Qwen-2.5-VL。

Result: ChatENV在时间和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），支持交互式场景分析。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的、基于传感器的环境监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 通过分析图像采集过程的参数和变换，研究这些参数在视觉表示中的编码方式及其对语义预测的影响。

Result: 研究发现，这些参数会被系统性地编码在视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，具体表现为正相关或负相关。

Conclusion: 论文指出，视觉编码器在训练过程中未见的图像采集参数和变换中，会系统性地编码这些参数，并对语义预测产生显著影响。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视图匹配增强了模型对街道分布的全局理解，显著提升了细粒度地址定位的性能。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,

TL;DR: HyperTea是一种结合CNN、RNN和HGNN的新方法，用于提升移动红外小目标检测性能，通过全局和局部时间增强模块以及特征对齐模块实现SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在MIRSTD中通常只建模低阶特征相关性，且局限于单一时间尺度。HyperTea旨在探索超图在高阶时空相关性建模中的潜力。

Method: HyperTea包含三个模块：GTEM用于全局时间上下文增强，LTEM用于局部运动模式捕捉和时间上下文增强，TAM用于解决跨尺度特征对齐问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，HyperTea在DAUB和IRDST数据集上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea通过整合CNN、RNN和HGNN，显著提升了MIRSTD的检测性能，并在DAUB和IRDST数据集上展示了SOTA性能。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

Motivation: 胎儿脑部MRI的T2映射在0.55T中场强下具有潜力，但由于依赖多次运动干扰的厚切片堆栈重建，导致扫描时间长且对运动敏感。

Method: 该方法通过联合重建多个回波时间的数据，结合隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化，建模T2衰减，从而在保留解剖和定量T2保真度的同时，实现信息共享。

Result: 研究在模拟胎儿脑部和体内成人数据集上展示了最先进的性能，并首次实现了0.55T下的体内胎儿T2映射。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在0.55T磁场下，通过结合隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化方法，成功实现了胎儿脑部T2映射的首次体内成像，并展示了减少每个回波时间所需堆栈数量的潜力。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Result: IADGPT 在异常检测、定位和推理任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: IADGPT 通过三阶段渐进式训练策略，显著提升了工业异常检测的性能，并在异常定位和推理任务中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级视图转换框架，结合TUNet和新型融合策略，利用预训练扩散模型生成高质量单图像视图合成结果，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，成本高昂且效果不佳（如模糊重建和泛化能力差）。本文旨在探索一种轻量级框架，直接利用预训练扩散模型的能力，提升单图像视图合成的质量和效率。

Method: 使用DDIM反转潜在空间中的单输入图像，通过TUNet预测目标视图的反转潜在，并提出一种基于DDIM反转噪声相关结构的新型融合策略，以保留纹理和细节。最终利用融合潜在作为DDIM采样的初始条件。

Result: 在MVImgNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视图合成任务中优于现有方法，能够生成更清晰、细节更丰富的图像。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种轻量级的视图转换框架，通过利用预训练扩散模型的高保真生成能力，结合相机姿态条件化的U-Net（TUNet）和新型融合策略，显著提升了单图像视图合成的效果。实验证明该方法在MVImgNet数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFNet结合事件相机和RGB相机，通过运动线索融合网络提升复杂交通环境下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在动态范围上的限制导致复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测效果。

Method: 提出MCFNet，包括事件校正模块（ECM）进行时间对齐，事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）提升空间分辨率，以及跨模态Mamba融合模块（CMM）实现自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet在低光照和快速移动场景中表现优异，mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过多模态融合和优化模块设计，显著提升了复杂交通环境下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Result: CountCluster在对象计数准确率上平均提升了18.5%，并在多种提示下表现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster方法通过优化对象交叉注意力图的分簇，显著提高了文本到图像生成中对象数量的准确性，无需依赖外部工具或额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: 神经网络方法可以有效解决星上SAR数据处理的资源限制问题，并支持实时监测应用。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Motivation: 现有的自回归生成模型仅利用索引值进行训练，忽略了代码本中丰富的标记相似性信息。k-means聚类在代码本特征空间中表现不佳，存在标记空间差异和质心距离不准确等问题。

Method: 提出DCPE方法，采用基于实例的距离替代质心距离，并通过凝聚合并技术解决标记空间差异问题。

Result: DCPE在LlamaGen-B上加速训练42%，并提高了FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效挖掘和利用代码本中的标记相似性信息，显著提升自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Motivation: 现有EgocentricQA研究局限于日常活动，而实际应用常面临领域差异，需评估模型在多样化领域的泛化能力。

Method: 构建EgoCross基准，涵盖手术、工业、极限运动和动物视角四个领域，包含约1000个QA对，支持多种任务和格式。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs在非日常生活领域泛化能力有限，初步探索了微调和强化学习的改进潜力。

Conclusion: EgoCross为推进领域自适应、鲁棒的视频理解提供了基础，未来需进一步优化模型跨域能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting

### [84] [Axis-level Symmetry Detection with Group-Equivariant Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10740)
*Wongyun Yu,Ahyun Seo,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对称性检测框架，通过几何基元（线和点）表示反射和旋转对称性，采用双分支架构，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中对称性检测的精度不足，现有方法在识别单个对称轴时缺乏精确性。

Method: 使用双分支架构，分别处理反射和旋转对称性，引入方向锚点和反射/旋转匹配机制。

Result: 在实验中表现出色，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何基元和双分支架构，显著提升了对称性检测的精度和性能。

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

*Lixin Jia,Zhiqing Guo,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FGL的策略和DPNet网络，用于提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力，有效应对未知伪造技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法在未知伪造技术的数据集上表现不佳，且传统方法难以应对快速迭代的伪造技术，亟需提升泛化能力。

Method: 采用FGL策略捕捉已知与未知伪造技术的差异信息，动态调整学习过程；设计DPNet网络，结合频率流和空间特征，利用图卷积感知伪造痕迹的关联性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同场景下泛化能力强，能有效处理未知伪造挑战。

Conclusion: FGL策略和DPNet网络为深度伪造检测提供了鲁棒支持，解决了泛化能力不足的问题。

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

*Tiancheng Han,Yunfei Gao,Yong Li,Wuzhou Yu,Qiaosheng Zhang,Wenqi Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过诊断分析主流视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间物理推理任务上的不足，提出了一种结合监督微调和基于规则的强化学习方法，显著提升了Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型的性能，但模型在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但当前视觉语言模型在这一任务上的表现尚未被充分探索。

Method: 采用监督微调（supervised fine-tuning）和基于规则的强化学习（rule-based reinforcement learning）方法改进Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 改进后的模型在空间物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越了主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管模型性能有所提升，但在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍然有限，表明需要进一步研究新的方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

*Jieyu Li,Xin Zhang,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个针对超真实AI生成视频检测的大规模基准测试，包含10,000多个真实和合成视频，并提供了多模态注释，用于评估和提升现有模型的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频真实性检测基准在真实性、规模和复杂性方面存在不足，无法有效评估现代视觉语言模型对复杂伪造视频的检测能力。

Method: AEGIS通过收集和标注10,000多个由多种先进生成模型生成的视频，并构建具有挑战性的子集和多模态注释，来填补这一空白。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限，突显了该数据集的独特复杂性和真实性。

Conclusion: AEGIS为视频真实性检测研究提供了一个不可或缺的评估基准，推动了开发更鲁棒、可靠且广泛适用的检测方法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE通过自适应稀疏注意力和稀疏感知蒸馏，显著加速视频生成并提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中存在迭代去噪过程慢和长序列二次注意力成本高的问题，现有加速方法难以有效结合。

Method: 提出BLADE框架，结合自适应块稀疏注意力机制（ASA）和稀疏感知的步蒸馏范式（基于TDM），实现高效训练和推理。

Result: BLADE在多个模型上实现了显著的加速（如Wan2.1-1.3B加速14.10倍）和质量提升（如VBench-2.0分数提高）。

Conclusion: BLADE框架通过自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏范式，显著提升了视频生成的效率和质量，并在多个模型上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFlowSR是一种基于扩散的RefSR框架，通过显式匹配LR和参考HR图像，解决了现有方法在信息对齐和数据集质量上的不足，并在UHD场景下展示了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的RefSR方法难以有效对齐LR和参考HR图像的信息，且现有数据集分辨率低、质量差，无法支持高质量恢复。

Method: 提出TriFlowSR框架，设计Reference Matching Strategy显式匹配LR和参考HR图像，并引入首个UHD场景的RefSR数据集Landmark-4K。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更好地利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对UHD场景下真实世界退化的基于扩散的RefSR框架，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统被动活体检测方法在区分真实面部与多种攻击（如打印照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频重放）时效果有限，需要更主动且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 设计了一种用户交互场景，要求参与者缓慢将面部靠近摄像头，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理时空特征。

Result: 该方法通过提取面部体积信息，显著提高了对真实面部与攻击的区分能力，优于被动方法。

Conclusion: 提出的主动交互结合光流分析的方法在活体检测中表现出更高的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: VasoMIM是一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习框架，通过结合血管解剖知识改进掩码图像建模，显著提升了血管分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线血管造影中血管分割的准确性对临床应用至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且传统MIM方法因类别不平衡难以捕捉血管解剖结构。

Method: 提出VasoMIM框架，包含解剖引导的掩码策略和解剖一致性损失，优先掩码血管区域并强化血管语义一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VasoMIM通过整合解剖知识有效提升了血管表示的可区分性，有望推动X射线血管造影分析。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Method: 提出 Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff)，首次基于布局提取对象先验形状，并引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失。此外，使用 DDPO 微调扩散过程。

Result: OF-Diff 在关键质量指标上优于现有方法，例如飞机、船只和车辆的 mAP 分别提高了 8.3%、7.7% 和 4.0%。

Conclusion: OF-Diff 通过提取对象先验形状并引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，显著提高了遥感图像生成的准确性和保真度，尤其在多态和小物体类别上表现突出。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo通过创新框架和数据集，显著提升了自监督立体匹配的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics is a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy.

Method: PhysHPO is a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, optimizing video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: Instance Level, State Level, Motion Level, and Semantic Level. It also introduces an automated data selection pipeline to identify 'good data' from existing datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality.

Conclusion: PhysHPO is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, significantly improving physical plausibility and overall video generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

*Mojtaba Safari,Shansong Wang,Mingzhe Hu,Zach Eidex,Qiang Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5系列模型在脑肿瘤视觉问答任务中表现中等，但未达到临床可用水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确区分脑肿瘤类型对治疗规划至关重要，大型语言模型（LLMs）的进展为结合图像解释与自然语言推理提供了可能。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、GPT-5-nano、GPT-5-mini和GPT-5在脑肿瘤视觉问答基准上的表现，使用零样本链式思维设置。

Result: GPT-5-mini表现最佳（44.19%），但不同肿瘤亚型的表现差异较大。

Conclusion: GPT-5系列模型在结构化神经肿瘤视觉问答任务中表现中等，但尚不适合临床使用。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将中间帧生成和上色统一为一个后关键帧阶段，通过稀疏草图注入和卡通适配方法提升控制精度和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画制作需要大量手动操作，现有AI方法处理各阶段分离导致错误累积和伪影。

Method: 采用稀疏草图注入机制和空间低秩适配器，将现代视频基础模型适配到卡通领域。

Result: ToonComposer在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助卡通制作提供了更优且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式处理和因果注意力机制高效处理图像序列，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单的内存机制，难以处理长序列和动态场景。

Method: 采用解码器-only Transformer框架，利用因果注意力机制和几何先验知识，实现流式处理。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优异，且兼容LLM式训练基础设施。

Conclusion: STream3R展示了因果Transformer模型在在线3D感知中的潜力，为实时3D理解铺平道路。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一种针对遥感数据的自监督学习方法，通过优化融合策略和目标归一化方案，在多时相任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自监督学习方法未充分考虑遥感数据的多模态、多时相和多光谱特性，需要针对这些特点进行优化。

Method: 提出了MAESTRO方法，基于Masked Autoencoder，优化了融合策略并引入光谱先验作为自监督信号。

Result: 在四个遥感数据集上，MAESTRO在多时相任务中达到新SOTA，在单时相任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO通过适应遥感数据特性，显著提升了自监督学习在遥感任务中的表现。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL提出了一种结合情景记忆和语义记忆的视频类增量学习方法，通过交叉注意力机制检索时间密集特征，显著减少内存需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在内存效率和性能之间存在权衡，要么存储时间密集样本导致内存不足，要么存储时间稀疏样本牺牲性能。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合情景记忆（存储时间稀疏特征）和语义记忆（可学习提示），通过内存检索模块（MR）利用交叉注意力机制从稀疏特征中检索密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集（如UCF-101、HMDB51等）上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存的同时实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL有效解决了视频类增量学习中的内存与性能权衡问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的跨领域3D人体运动模型HiC，通过单阶段训练和上下文学习，解决了现有方法依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨领域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)，利用上下文学习和统一框架处理多模态、任务和数据集。

Result: HiC在泛化性、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展示了统一跨领域模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC通过改进的灵活性和可扩展性，为构建统一的跨领域3D人体运动模型提供了可能。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态3D模型转化为动态内容时依赖专家干预的瓶颈问题。

Method: 系统采用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，结合基于注意力的架构推断皮肤权重，并通过可微分优化生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Puppeteer在骨骼预测准确性和皮肤权重质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Puppeteer框架通过自动化的骨骼预测、皮肤权重推断和动画生成，显著提升了3D模型的动态内容生成效率和质量，适用于多样化的3D内容。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Motivation: 量子隐式神经表示（QINRs）是一种新兴的范式，但其在架构设计、量子力学特性利用、训练效率以及与经典模块的交互方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在通过提出一种新型的QINR（QVF）来解决这些问题。

Method: QVF 使用基于可学习能量流形的神经振幅编码将经典数据编码为量子态向量，采用完全纠缠的可学习参数化量子电路设计，并在实际希尔伯特空间中执行量子操作。

Result: QVF 在量子硬件模拟器上的实验表明，其在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线模型，特别是在高频细节学习方面表现突出。

Conclusion: QVF 是一种新型的量子隐式神经表示方法，通过量子态向量编码经典数据，并在实际希尔伯特空间中实现数值稳定的训练和快速收敛。实验表明，QVF 在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线模型，并展示了在2D和3D场补全及形状插值中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

Result: 发现了新的应用，并展示了改进的主题建模方法在人类对齐上的优势。

Conclusion: 研究为教育工作者和学生提供了GenAI使用的参考，同时提出了未来研究的开放问题。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

Motivation: 研究AI陪伴行为的潜在影响，尤其是情感支持和边界设置对用户福祉的重要性。

Method: 通过心理学理论和用户数据，开发了一个包含31种行为的分类法，并设计了368个针对性提示来评估语言模型的陪伴行为。

Result: 应用INTIMA基准测试发现，所有模型普遍倾向于强化陪伴行为，但不同模型在敏感部分的表现存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管不同模型在情感支持方面表现不同，但普遍存在过度强化陪伴行为的倾向，这凸显了需要更一致的方法来处理情感互动。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了XFacta数据集和半自动检测框架，用于改进多模态大语言模型在社交媒体虚假信息检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态虚假信息检测中存在瓶颈，且数据集过时或人工合成，无法反映真实场景。

Method: 引入XFacta数据集，系统评估多种MLLM检测策略，并提出半自动检测框架。

Result: 提供了对MLLM模型设计的全面分析，并发布了代码和数据。

Conclusion: XFacta和半自动框架为多模态虚假信息检测领域提供了有价值的实践和见解。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中文本分类模型因数据不足而难以训练的问题。

Method: 提出了一种自动化工作流程，通过搜索输入示例以生成更有效的合成数据，并研究了三种搜索策略。

Result: 实验证明，集成方法比单独使用任何一种搜索策略更能有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过集成算法选择最佳搜索策略，能够更有效地利用LLM生成的合成数据提升文本分类模型的性能。

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为HiFACT的新基准数据集，用于解决低资源混合语言（如Hinglish）中的事实核查问题，并提出了一个图感知的检索增强模型，在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查系统主要针对高资源单语环境，无法适应印度等多语言地区的政治话语，而Hinglish在政治人物中的广泛使用和社会媒体的影响使得开发多语言、上下文感知的事实核查工具变得迫切。

Method: 论文提出了一个图感知的检索增强事实核查模型，结合多语言上下文编码、声明-证据语义对齐、证据图构建、图神经网络推理和自然语言解释生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，HiFACTMix在准确性上优于现有的多语言基线模型，并能为其裁决提供可信的论证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言、混合语言和政治背景的事实核查研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的词嵌入矩阵中的语义关联与人类评分的低维结构相似，且语义特征在LLMs中的纠缠方式与人类语言相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs中语义关联的结构是否与人类语言中的低维语义结构相似。

Method: 通过分析LLMs词嵌入矩阵中词语在反义词对定义的语义方向上的投影，并与人类评分进行对比。

Result: LLMs中的语义投影可简化为3维子空间，与人类调查结果相似，且语义特征的纠缠方式与人类语言一致。

Conclusion: LLMs中的语义信息具有低维特性，理解这种结构对于避免在调整特征时产生意外后果至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，注意力权重在解释Transformer模型预测时的帮助有限，但其感知效果受可视化方式影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨注意力权重是否能为生物医学文献分类提供有用的解释，并研究不同可视化方式对其感知效果的影响。

Method: 通过用户研究，让医学专家使用不同可视化方式的注意力权重进行文献分类任务。

Result: XLNet模型分类准确，但注意力权重解释效果不佳；可视化方式显著影响其感知效果，用户偏好直观形式（如文本亮度或背景色）。

Conclusion: 注意力权重的解释效果有限，但可视化方式的选择可以显著影响其感知效果。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

Conclusion: EQGBench为教育问题生成提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型可以自动化AIHQ开放式回答的评分，与人类评分一致，适用于研究和临床环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少AIHQ开放式问题评分的时间和人力成本，提高效率。

Method: 使用已收集的数据集，对大型语言模型进行微调，测试其与人类评分的一致性。

Result: 微调后的模型与人类评分高度一致，适用于不同场景和人群。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以高效自动化AIHQ评分，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Result: 贝叶斯融合方法的性能优于单独分类器，并与微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种有效且资源高效的方法，可替代昂贵的LLM微调。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Motivation: 硬参数共享在多任务学习中常导致任务干扰，影响模型性能。

Method: 使用监督混合专家模型（S-MoE），通过指导令牌将任务路由到专用专家网络，避免训练门控函数。

Result: 在语音转文本任务中，S-MoE实现了6.35%的词错误率相对改进。

Conclusion: S-MoE是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著减少任务干扰并提升多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM既能生成有害的错误信息，也能用于检测和防止其传播，研究旨在探索其在这两方面的潜力。

Method: 分析了109种针对三种目标LLM的越狱攻击，比较了攻击提示与真实健康相关查询，并评估了生成错误信息与Reddit上的错误信息的差异。

Result: LLM能有效检测来自其他LLM和人类的错误信息，支持其在构建更健康信息生态系统中的作用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计，LLM可以为信息生态系统的健康发展做出贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Result: Bing-Precise（66.2%）和Bing-Creative（61.4%）超过及格线（60%），但其他模型表现不佳，且所有模型在答案一致性上存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在营养学考试中表现有限，需进一步改进以提供可靠的学习辅助工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱探索方法在粒度匹配和上下文利用上存在不足，限制了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现。

Method: 提出GG Explore框架，利用引导图抽象目标知识结构并保留语义上下文，结合结构对齐和上下文感知剪枝技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中效率更高且性能优于现有技术，同时在小规模LLMs上表现良好。

Conclusion: GG Explore通过引导图有效平衡了知识探索的精确性和效率，为LLMs在知识密集型任务中的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge 是一种可控生成多跳推理问题的框架，通过语义图编织和 AMR 分析提升 LLM 训练数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量、推理密集型问答对稀缺的问题，尤其是在稀疏领域（如 PubMed 论文或法律文档）中。

Method: 通过语义图编织（包括实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接）和 AMR 驱动的分析，系统构建跨文档的复杂推理路径。

Result: 在通用和专用领域（如生物医学）中表现优异，生成的问题对在复杂性和可回答性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge 提出了一种新的范式，用于从稀疏数据源中可控地生成目标推理问题，显著提升了 LLM 训练数据的质量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的角色扮演评估方法缺乏验证，可能无法反映人类对角色忠实度的感知。

Method: 提出了PersonaEval基准，使用人类创作的对话数据测试LLM的角色识别能力，并通过人类研究对比性能。

Result: 最佳LLM的准确率仅为69%，远低于人类的90.8%，表明LLM评估器在角色识别任务上仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前LLM评估器在角色识别任务上的表现远低于人类水平，表明其在角色扮演评估中的可靠性不足。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练的多模态大语言模型编排框架，通过显式工作流协调专用模型，提升效率、可解释性和交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs难以直接整合为统一的多模态输入输出系统，传统方法依赖训练且存在模态对齐、效率等问题。

Method: 基于三个创新：中央控制器LLM、并行TTS架构和跨模态记忆集成系统，实现动态任务路由和全双工交互。

Result: 在标准基准上性能提升7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，并通过显式编排增强可解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration无需训练即可实现高效多模态交互，为模块化AI系统提供新范式。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

Motivation: 自然语言中存在大量语义相同但表达不同的句子，而大语言模型通常无法为这些句子生成相同的下一个词概率。现有方法（如k-NN平滑估计）是经验性的，缺乏理论支持。

Method: 引入了一个LLM Markov范畴来表示大语言模型生成的语言概率分布，并利用范畴同伦技术（如高阶代数K理论和模型范畴）捕捉语义等价性（“弱等价”）。

Result: 通过范畴同伦理论，论文为语义等价句子的概率分布问题提供了理论框架，解决了传统方法中非同构箭头的问题。

Conclusion: 论文展示了范畴同伦理论在大语言模型中的应用潜力，为语义等价性问题提供了抽象且强大的理论工具。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在处理复杂多变的自然语言时面临双重负担，导致推理能力受限。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，通过三步迭代算法（映射、对齐、训练）分离理解与推理，并在规范问题空间中训练推理策略。

Result: 实验表明，DURIT显著提升了SLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中的性能，并增强了推理的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分离理解与推理是提升SLMs推理能力的有效策略，DURIT框架为此提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

Motivation: 在联邦学习环境中，提升大型语言模型的推理能力面临性能与计算、通信和隐私约束的平衡问题，尤其是在医疗领域，需要准确且可解释的推理结果。

Method: FedCoT采用轻量级的思维链增强机制，本地模型生成多条推理路径，并通过紧凑的判别器动态选择最优路径，同时利用改进的LoRA模块堆叠聚合方法处理客户端异构性。

Result: 在医疗推理任务上的实验表明，FedCoT在严格资源预算下显著提升了客户端推理性能，同时完全保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT通过创新的思维链增强和聚合方法，有效解决了联邦学习中推理能力提升的挑战，特别是在医疗领域，为安全、可解释的决策提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 直接使用LLM处理长事件序列计算成本高且不切实际，需要一种更高效的方法来学习客户历史通信的嵌入表示。

Method: 提出LATTE，一种对比学习框架，通过将行为特征总结为短提示并由LLM嵌入，作为对比损失的监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，LATTE在真实金融数据集上优于现有的事件序列表示学习方法。

Conclusion: LATTE框架通过对比学习将原始事件嵌入与冻结LLM的语义嵌入对齐，显著降低了推理成本和输入大小，同时在延迟敏感环境中保持可部署性。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多种语言任务中表现出色，但容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，这些攻击会绕过其安全对齐机制。

Method: LFJ通过选择主题和句法相似的查询对，在关键层和令牌上进行梯度引导的隐藏状态插值，并进行优化以平衡攻击成功、输出流畅性和计算效率。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2等模型上的评估显示，LFJ的平均攻击成功率为94.01%，优于现有方法。对抗训练防御方法能将ASR降低80%以上。

Conclusion: LFJ通过隐藏状态插值和优化策略有效绕过LLMs的安全机制，同时提出的防御方法显著降低了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该研究为高风险问答应用中可信赖的大语言模型部署提供了一个统计框架。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个混合评估框架MDH，结合了LLM和人工辅助，用于恶意内容检测和数据集清理，并提出了两种新的攻击策略D-Attack和DH-CoT。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Motivation: 现有TTC策略在不同查询上效果不一，盲目应用会导致高计算成本，需要一种自适应选择方法。

Method: 提出RTTC框架，利用预训练奖励模型选择最佳TTC策略，并结合分布式架构和查询状态缓存。

Result: 实验表明RTTC在多个LLM和基准测试中优于传统RAG或TTT，验证了其高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: RTTC证明了自适应TTC策略选择的必要性，为高性能语言模型适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental

associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information

introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法未考虑推理策略，而用户偏好和预算对提示和推理配置有重要影响。

Method: 提出IAPO框架和PSST算法，联合优化提示和推理规模，分析有限预算下的错误概率。

Result: 在六项任务中验证PSST的有效性，证明推理感知对黑盒LLM对齐的关键作用。

Conclusion: IAPO通过联合优化提示和推理规模，显著提升黑盒LLM的对齐和性能。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs的思考模式更容易被Jailbreak攻击攻破，提出了一种安全思考干预方法，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs的思考模式在Jailbreak攻击中表现脆弱，尤其是教育用途和过长思考长度时，LLMs仍会给出有害答案。

Method: 通过添加特定思考标记到提示中，显式引导LLMs的内部思考过程。

Result: 安全思考干预显著降低了思考模式下LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 安全思考干预是一种有效的方法，可减少LLMs思考模式下的安全风险。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Motivation: 传统选择策略忽视了模型混淆的关键来源，即生成信息抽取任务所需的结构化格式的困难。APIE旨在通过量化格式和内容不确定性来解决这一问题。

Method: APIE框架通过双组分不确定性度量（格式不确定性和内容不确定性）来评估LLM的混淆程度，并主动选择最具挑战性和信息量的样本作为少样本示例。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，APIE显著优于基线方法，提高了抽取准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: APIE框架通过引入自省混淆原则和双组分不确定性度量，显著提升了LLM在少样本信息抽取任务中的表现，强调了细粒度、双层次模型不确定性在构建高效可靠结构化生成系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Motivation: 当前推理增强的大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其利用不同人类推理技能的机制尚未充分研究，尤其是在涉及多语言和跨文化常识推理时。

Method: 提出了mSCoRe基准，包含三个关键组件：新的推理技能分类法、针对常识推理评估的数据合成流程，以及动态调整任务难度的复杂度扩展框架。

Result: 实验表明，mSCoRe对当前最先进的大语言模型仍具有显著挑战性，尤其是在更高复杂度级别时，模型在多语言常识推理中存在局限性。

Conclusion: mSCoRe基准为评估和改进大语言模型的多语言常识推理能力提供了系统方法，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在清晰完整的问题上表现良好，但在复杂交互式任务中表现不佳，因此需要开发能够处理多轮对话和推理的模型。

Method: 引入了一个包含多轮任务的基准测试套件，每个任务设计用于测试特定推理、交互对话和信息寻求能力，并采用确定性评分机制。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在这些任务中存在显著不足，主要错误源于指令遵循、推理和规划能力差。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来研究提供了重要见解，有助于改进大语言模型在复杂交互场景中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

TL;DR: LaaJMeter是一个基于模拟的框架，用于在低资源领域中对LLM评估器进行受控元评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域中，LLM评估器的有效性难以验证，且缺乏已验证的评估指标。

Result: 在代码翻译任务中，展示了不同指标对评估器质量的敏感性差异。

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境中的LLM评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于确保NLP评估的可信性和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

Method: 定义了翻译难度任务，提出新评估指标，并开发了Sentinel-src模型。

Result: Sentinel-src模型优于启发式方法和LLM评估，并发布了两个改进模型。

Conclusion: 翻译难度估计有助于开发更具区分性的评估方法和指导未来研究。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的透明度和可解释性，避免传统方法依赖Hessian信息或模型重训练的高计算成本。

Method: 利用基础模型的丰富表示，通过单次前向传播和简单闭式表达式计算样本影响力分数。

Result: For-Value在识别有影响力的微调样本和检测错误标注数据方面表现优异，与基于梯度的方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: For-Value为大规模模型提供了一种高效、准确的样本影响力评估方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

TL;DR: PakBBQ是一个针对巴基斯坦文化和区域背景的偏见基准数据集，用于评估多语言LLMs的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数LLMs的训练和评估数据以西方为中心，忽视了低资源语言和区域背景，导致公平性问题。

Method: 引入PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个QA对，覆盖8个偏见维度，并在英语和乌尔都语中评估LLMs。

Result: 实验显示：(i) 消歧后准确率平均提高12%；(ii) 乌尔都语的反偏见行为强于英语；(iii) 负面提问减少刻板印象。

Conclusion: 强调情境化基准和简单提示工程在低资源环境中减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级框架SDM，用于检测LLM生成的文本是否与输入上下文严重偏离，即Faithfulness Hallucinations。通过多提示和多回答的语义一致性测试，结合信息论指标量化语义差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的文本常出现非事实性、无意义或不忠实的内容（即幻觉），现有方法如Semantic Entropy仅测试单一固定提示下的回答多样性，缺乏对多提示语义一致性的检测。

Method: 提出SDM框架，通过联合聚类创建提示和回答的共享主题空间，利用信息论指标（如Jensen-Shannon散度和Wasserstein距离）量化语义差异，并引入Semantic Box分类LLM回答类型。

Result: SDM能有效检测Faithfulness Hallucinations，并通过KL散度识别Semantic Exploration，区分不同生成行为。

Conclusion: SDM为检测LLM幻觉提供了轻量且高效的解决方案，尤其擅长识别危险的自信虚构（confident confabulation）。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中BPRS评分需要长时间结构化访谈，限制了其应用。LLM可以简化这一过程。

Method: 使用409名临床高风险患者的访谈记录，通过LLM零样本预测BPRS评分。

Result: LLM预测的BPRS评分与真实评估的吻合度高（中位数一致性0.84，ICC 0.73），且在多语言和纵向信息整合中表现良好。

Conclusion: LLM在标准化和改善临床高风险患者评估方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

Motivation: LLM对提示词的小变化敏感，部分原因是其内在的归纳偏置。通过利用LLM的输出优化提示词，可以更好地匹配模型的偏置。

Method: 提出归纳偏置提取与匹配策略（Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching），利用LLM的输出作为提示词的一部分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分类任务中提升Likert评分达19%，在排序任务中提升达27%。

Conclusion: 通过匹配LLM的归纳偏置，可以有效提升提示词的效果，为LLM的应用提供新思路。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见检测方法多为定量和自动化，忽略了语言中偏见的微妙表现，因此需要定性方法来补充。

Method: 通过手动分析LLM生成的关于黑人和白人女性的短故事，研究性别和种族偏见。

Result: 黑人女性被描绘为与祖先和抵抗相关，而白人女性则出现在自我发现过程中；模型在纠正偏见时仅提供表面修订。

Conclusion: 研究强调了跨学科方法对AI设计和部署的重要性，以解决LLM如何反映和延续不平等的问题。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec是一种新方法，通过频谱视角平衡语义和协作信息，解决了LLM推荐系统中协作信号衰减的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统倾向于过度强调用户交互历史中的语义相关性，导致协作信号在传播过程中逐渐减弱。

Method: 使用全局图低通滤波器（G-LPF）净化嵌入，并通过时间频率调制（TFM）逐层保留协作信号。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FreLLM4Rec显著提升了性能，NDCG@10最高提升8.00%。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec为LLM处理协作信息提供了新视角，并改进了基于LLM的推荐系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了跨提示编码器（XPE）和双软提示机制，用于提升低性能语言在多语言任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示编码器在跨语言迁移中的潜力，特别是针对低性能语言。

Method: 提出XPE（结合轻量级编码架构和多源训练）和双软提示机制（结合编码器提示和标准软提示）。

Result: XPE对低性能语言最有效，而混合变体在多语言环境中适应性更广。

Conclusion: XPE和双软提示机制为多语言任务提供了有效的解决方案，尤其适用于低性能语言。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在韩语推理任务中的表现不足问题，并提升其在韩语任务中的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督微调（SFT）在高质量韩语推理数据集上进行训练；第二阶段采用定制的GRPO算法进行强化学习，并通过引入oracle judge模型解决训练稳定性问题。

Result: 最终模型在高级推理任务（如数学和编程）中表现显著提升，同时保持了知识和语言能力，能够完全以韩语进行内部思维链。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了大语言模型在韩语推理任务中的稳定学习和性能提升，为多语言推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

Result: 方法在跨语言ABSA任务中性能提升高达10%，并能处理更复杂的任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，且优于英语中心的大型语言模型。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Conclusion: 这些贡献为捷克语文本摘要提供了新潜力，并为捷克历史文本处理研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的约束解码方法，显著提升了跨语言ABSA任务的性能，并为实际应用提供了实用建议。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器识别和操纵文本中的关键特征，通过特征聚类和选择性扰动生成对抗文本。

Result: 实验表明，SFPF生成的对抗文本能够绕过最先进的防御机制，揭示了当前NLP系统的持续脆弱性。

Conclusion: SFPF方法在对抗攻击中表现出色，但其效果因提示和层而异，且对其他架构和更大模型的通用性仍需验证。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在长上下文叙事理解中表现不足，因其静态、单步检索过程无法捕捉动态的关联关系。

Result: 在四个长上下文叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG比最强基线提升了11%的性能。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为长上下文理解提供了一种基于认知原理的状态推理范式，特别适用于需要全局理解的复杂查询。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

TL;DR: Chinese idiom translation is challenging for modern systems; IdiomEval improves error detection with a 0.68 F$_1$ score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in machine translation, little is known about Chinese idiom translation, which is complex due to historical references and structural patterns.

Method: The authors introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy, and annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern systems across four domains.

Result: Modern systems, including GPT-4, fail at idiom translation, with errors in 28% of cases. Existing metrics poorly measure idiom quality, while the improved models achieve an F$_1$ score of 0.68 for error detection.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges in Chinese idiom translation by modern systems and proposes improved models for better error detection.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Method: 引入计算经济学框架，将LLM视为资源受限的代理（注意力头和神经元块）的内部经济，通过激励驱动的训练范式优化计算分配。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上，该方法显著减少了FLOPS和延迟，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 经济原则为设计高效、自适应且透明的LLMs提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Conclusion: DiFaR在多样性、事实性和相关性三个维度上显著提升了理由生成的质量，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the intersection of explainability and privacy in NLP, as there is a lack of research on whether these two goals can be achieved simultaneously.

Method: The study uses empirical investigation, focusing on Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability methods.

Result: The results reveal an intricate relationship between privacy and explainability, influenced by task nature and method choices, showing potential for coexistence.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that privacy and explainability can coexist in NLP, but their relationship is complex and depends on factors like the task and methods used. It provides practical recommendations for future research.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中表现出色，但存在文本主导问题，即过度依赖文本而忽视其他模态。本文旨在系统研究这一问题。

Method: 提出了两个评估指标（MDI和AEI）来衡量模态不平衡，并通过深入分析揭示了文本主导的三个根本原因。此外，提出了一种标记压缩方法。

Result: 研究发现文本主导在所有测试模态中普遍存在。提出的标记压缩方法显著降低了LLaVA-7B的MDI值，从10.23降至0.86。

Conclusion: 本文的分析和方法框架为开发更公平和全面的多模态语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study on the deployment of a European Deep
Inference Fabric (eDIF), an NDIF-compatible infrastructure designed to support
mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球数百万聋人和听力障碍者依赖手语沟通，但在以口语为主的社会中，手语常被低估，导致沟通障碍和社会排斥。该项目旨在通过改进翻译方法来缩小这一差距。

Method: 融合了Transformer和STGCN-LSTM架构，探索了多种融合策略，实现了无注释翻译。

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VAC框架通过自然语言反馈（NLF）替代标量奖励，提升个性化问答的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化大语言模型的方法依赖标量奖励，反馈较弱，限制了学习效率和个性化质量。

Method: VAC框架使用NLF作为监督信号，通过交替优化反馈模型和策略模型，实现个性化响应生成。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，人类评估也证实生成响应质量更高。

Conclusion: NLF为优化个性化问答提供了更有效的信号。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

TL;DR: ICE是一种针对dLLMs设计的in-place提示框架，通过双向注意力机制和早期退出机制，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs的前缀提示和顺序生成限制了双向信息的灵活性，dLLMs的双向注意力机制和迭代细化过程为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: ICE框架采用in-place提示和置信度感知的早期退出机制，优化了dLLMs的迭代细化过程。

Result: 实验表明，ICE在GSM8K上实现了17.29%的准确率提升和4.12倍的加速，在MMLU上实现了276.67倍的加速，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ICE框架通过其独特的in-place提示和早期退出机制，显著提升了dLLMs的性能和效率，为双向信息处理提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

Result: 在182份ICLR 2025投稿上评估，与人类评审的新颖性结论一致率达75.3%，推理对齐率达86.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化LLM辅助方法可提升评审的严谨性和透明度，同时保留人类专家的作用。

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在序列决策任务中潜力巨大，但依赖大模型导致计算成本高，需要提升小型模型的性能。现有方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出MS-GRPO算法，基于TSMG和LAP框架，通过累积奖励分配和绝对优势加权采样策略优化小型LLM。

Result: 在Snake和Frozen Lake任务中，3B参数模型表现优于72B基线50%。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练是替代模型规模扩展的实用高效方法，可提升LLM在序列决策任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Motivation: Reduce dependence on costly interactions with external search engines by leveraging LLMs as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in RL.

Method: Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability through format-based and rule-based rewards.

Result: SSRL-trained policy models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: 1) LLMs possess world knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search engines without additional effort.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Conclusion: 开源DRA系统ODR+通过改进在性能上超越了现有闭源系统，为学术研究提供了可行的开源选择。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA

on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs的长输出增加计算成本并可能导致过度思考，需平衡推理效率与质量。

Method: 分析生成路径分布和难度估计，提出LCPO方法直接平衡隐式奖励与NLL损失。

Result: 实验显示LCPO在多个基准上平均输出长度减少50%以上，推理性能不变。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了计算高效方法在指导LRMs高效推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: KompeteAI是一个新型AutoML框架，通过动态解决方案空间探索和RAG技术，解决了现有LLM-based AutoML系统的探索局限和执行瓶颈，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略受限和执行瓶颈的问题，如缺乏多样性和无法重组部分解决方案，以及冗长的代码验证周期。

Method: KompeteAI引入动态解决方案空间探索，包括合并阶段和RAG技术，并结合预测评分模型和加速调试方法。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中平均优于其他方法3%，并将管道评估速度提升6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法解决了AutoML的关键问题，并在性能上实现了显著提升，同时提出了新的基准测试Kompete-bench。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Motivation: 旨在通过熵势概念统一和加强智能系统中的不确定性建模，提升AI的决策能力和可解释性。

Method: 通过引入事件中心度量，将熵势概念从物理学调整到AI领域，强调条件期望以考虑反事实情景。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于熵势的框架，用于增强人工智能中的不确定性量化、决策制定和可解释性，为AI系统提供了一种理论扎实且多功能的方法。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考问题，导致计算资源浪费和效率降低。现有方法需要预设令牌预算或选择推理模式，缺乏灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，根据推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，结合PPO和Reinforce++进行训练。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25等数学推理基准测试中，VSRM显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了原始推理性能，有效抑制了无效步骤并鼓励有效推理。

Conclusion: VSRM通过逐步奖励机制有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，实现了效率与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 传统HATRPO中固定KL阈值可能导致更新缓慢和局部最优，尤其在异构环境中。

Method: 提出了两种KL阈值分配方法：基于KKT的HATRPO-W和基于贪婪算法的HATRPO-G。

Result: 实验结果显示，HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G在最终性能上均提升超过22.5%，且HATRPO-W学习更稳定。

Conclusion: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G通过动态分配KL阈值，显著提升了HATRPO的性能，实现了更快的收敛和更高的最终奖励。HATRPO-W在稳定性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了大型语言模型在想象力推理方面的能力限制，并提出了一个基于“乌龟汤”游戏的综合研究框架，为未来探索性代理行为研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过结合知识聚合和检索策略，显著提升了检索增强生成的效率和质量，减少了冗余检索，并在多个QA基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV上表现优异，对未见代码保持高准确率。

Conclusion: HiRef通过本体和EHR结合，显著提升了药物推荐的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成SPARQL查询时因缺乏SKG特定内容和模式知识导致的结构不一致和语义不准确问题。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，评估了多种配置。

Result: 微调配置表现最佳，ROUGE-L达0.90，RelaxedEM达0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL通过模块化设计有效提升了SKG问答任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Result: SEQ-GPT能够通过自然语言交互动态调整搜索，并支持用户反馈，从而更高效地完成空间范例查询（SEQ）。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和自然语言处理，显著提升了空间查询的灵活性和用户体验，特别是在处理复杂任务如多位置联合搜索时。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B模型，具备深度思考能力，能够主导诊断流程并建立责任框架。

Result: 在罕见、复杂和真实病例中，DxDirector-7B显著优于现有医学LLM和通用LLM，减少医生工作量并提高准确性。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转变为诊断主导者，为高效准确的诊断提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

TL;DR: PASS 是一种多模态框架，通过概率注释的自适应工作流程解决了医疗 AI 中的黑盒推理和多模态集成问题，显著提升了性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在现实世界中存在黑盒推理、多模态集成不足和计算效率低的问题，尤其是在医疗领域。

Method: PASS 采用三阶段训练流程（专家知识预热、对比路径排序和成本感知强化学习），并利用多工具图的自适应采样来优化工作流程。

Result: PASS 在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型（如准确率、AUC、LLM-J），同时平衡了计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS 通过其概率注释的决策路径和自适应工作流程，显著提升了医疗 AI 的安全性和可解释性，同时在性能和成本之间实现了平衡。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Result: 实验表明，对齐阶段假设在多种模型和方法中具有普适性，动态数据的效果在不同阶段有显著差异。

Conclusion: 结论是理解对齐阶段的不同需求可以优化语言模型的对齐过程，提高模型性能。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂领域（如数学）的推理能力仍面临挑战，而现有的基于价值的验证方法因蒙特卡洛样本数量有限导致估计误差。

Method: 提出ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器来构建无偏估计器，减少方差且不增加额外计算成本。

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS比回归优化方法高出2.8分，比无方差减少的基线高出2.2分。

Conclusion: ComMCS方法有效减少了估计误差，提升了数学推理任务的性能，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

TL;DR: MSRS是一种通过子空间表示微调实现多属性控制的新框架，减少属性间干扰并提升控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多属性联合控制时存在干扰和权衡问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: MSRS通过分配正交子空间隔离属性影响，结合共享子空间和动态权重函数实现精确控制。

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多样下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性控制提供了高效且通用的框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: STEP是一种基于预训练语言模型的对话推荐系统，通过课程引导的上下文-知识融合和轻量级任务特定提示调优，提升了推荐和对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统在捕捉用户偏好和对话上下文的深层语义方面存在挑战，尤其是如何有效整合外部知识图谱信息。

Method: STEP采用三阶段课程逐步对齐对话上下文与知识图谱实体，并通过两个自适应前缀提示（对话前缀和推荐前缀）注入冻结的语言模型。

Result: STEP在两个公共数据集上的推荐精度和对话质量优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过创新的上下文-知识融合和双提示方案，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts

incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Result: 实验表明，Agentic-DRS 在 DRS-BENCH 基准测试中优于现有基线，并通过消融实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Agentic-DRS 在评估图形设计和生成可操作反馈方面表现出色，有望推动这一实用但尚未充分探索的研究方向。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将规划状态表示为全连接图，导致边缘信息组合爆炸和稀疏性问题，尤其是在大规模网格环境中。

Method: 提出了一种稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示方法，选择性地编码相关局部关系并显式整合与目标相关的空间特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效扩展到之前密集图表示无法处理的大网格尺寸，并显著提高了策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理现实世界中大规模广义规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies human reactions to AI-generated content, introduces the MhAIM Dataset, and proposes T-Lens, an LLM-based system with HR-MCP to predict human responses, aiming to mitigate misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated content increases misinformation risks. Prior research focused on authenticity, but less is known about its influence on human perception and behavior, especially in domains like trading where predicting reactions is critical.

Method: The research introduces the MhAIM Dataset with 154,552 online posts (111,153 AI-generated) and conducts a human study. It proposes three new metrics (trustworthiness, impact, openness) and develops T-Lens, an LLM-based agent system with HR-MCP for predicting human responses.

Result: People are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text and visuals, especially with inconsistencies. The study provides empirical insights and tools (T-Lens, HR-MCP) to align LLMs with human reactions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of understanding human reactions to AI-generated content and proposes actionable strategies to mitigate misinformation risks. It introduces tools like T-Lens and HR-MCP to enhance LLMs' human-awareness capabilities.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

TL;DR: 论文通过临床试验自然语言推理基准测试，发现当前大语言模型在知识获取和推理能力之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否通过数据规模和参数扩展就能获得结构化、可泛化的内部表示。

Method: 引入临床试验自然语言推理基准（含四种推理类型），并使用GKMRV探针分离知识获取和推理失败。

Result: 模型在GKMRV探针上表现优异（准确率0.918），但在主推理任务上表现差（准确率0.25），且输出高度一致（一致性0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型缺乏结构化、可组合的内部表示，导致在高风险领域推理不可靠。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 尽管XAI在关键决策领域应用广泛，但其对视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双管齐下的方法：文献综述（79项研究）和四部分概念验证（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）。

Result: 初步结果表明，简化解释比详细解释更易理解，且多模态呈现有助于提升公平可解释性。

Conclusion: XAI设计需考虑视觉障碍用户，简化解释和多模态呈现是实现包容性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于纯化输出反馈的分布鲁棒遗憾最优（DRRO）控制，针对受加性扰动和测量噪声影响的线性系统。通过设计仿射控制器，最小化Wasserstein模糊集内所有分布的最坏情况预期遗憾，并利用对偶理论将问题转化为半定规划（SDP）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对线性系统中存在未知联合概率分布的扰动和噪声，传统控制方法可能无法有效应对不确定性，因此需要一种鲁棒性更强的控制策略。

Method: 采用仿射控制器设计，利用Wasserstein模糊集描述不确定性，并通过分布鲁棒优化的对偶理论将问题转化为SDP。

Result: 通过消除部分决策变量，将SDP进一步转化为分布式优化问题，提升了可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRRO控制方法在应对线性系统中的不确定性时表现出色，通过SDP和分布式优化实现了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust regret-optimal (DRRO) control with
purified output feedback for linear systems subject to additive disturbances
and measurement noise. These uncertainties (including the initial system state)
are assumed to be stochastic and distributed according to an unknown joint
probability distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We design affine
controllers to minimise the worst-case expected regret over all distributions
in this set. The expected regret is defined as the difference between an
expected cost incurred by an affine causal controller and the expected cost
incurred by the optimal noncausal controller with perfect knowledge of the
disturbance trajectory at the outset. Leveraging the duality theory in
distributionally robust optimisation, we derive strong duality results for
worst-case expectation problems involving general quadratic objective
functions, enabling exact reformulations of the DRRO control problem as
semidefinite programs (SDPs). Focusing on one such reformulation, we eliminate
certain decision variables. This technique also permits a further equivalent
reformulation of the SDP as a distributed optimisation problem, with potential
to enhance scalability.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了高阶矩时间不一致控制问题的闭环强均衡策略，通过扩展目标函数并利用偏微分方程简化结果，验证了纳什均衡控制是否为强均衡策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间不一致性导致动态规划原则不适用，纳什均衡控制仅为静态点，无法保证在博弈论视角下达到最大值，因此需要研究强均衡策略。

Method: 通过扩展目标函数对应尖峰偏差的高阶变分因子，并利用纳什均衡控制满足的偏微分方程简化结果，推导强均衡策略的充分条件。

Result: 在模型参数为常数时，均值-方差问题的纳什均衡控制必为强均衡策略，而均值-方差-偏度-峰度问题的纳什均衡控制不一定为强均衡策略。

Conclusion: 强均衡策略为解决时间不一致控制问题提供了更优的解决方案，尤其在均值-方差问题中表现良好，但在高阶矩问题中仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we study closed-loop strong equilibrium strategies for the
time-inconsistent control problem with higher-order moments formulated by [Wang
et al. SIAM J. Control. Optim., 63 (2025), 1560--1589]. Since
time-inconsistency makes the dynamic programming principle inapplicable, the
problem is treated as a game between the decision maker and her future selves.
As a time-consistent solution, the previously proposed Nash equilibrium control
is merely a stationary point and does not necessarily reach a maximum in the
game-theoretical prospective. To address this issue, we consider the strong
equilibrium strategy, from which any spike deviation will be worse off. We
derive sufficient conditions for strong equilibrium strategies by expanding the
objective function corresponding to the spike deviation with respect to the
variational factor up to higher orders, and simplify the result by exploiting
the partial differential equations that a Nash equilibrium control satisfies.
Next, we examine whether the derived Nash equilibrium control is a strong
equilibrium strategy. In particular, we provide a sufficient condition for the
case with linear controlled equations. When the model parameters are constant,
we find that the derived Nash equilibrium control for the mean-variance problem
must be a strong equilibrium strategy, while that for the
mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis problem is not necessarily a strong equilibrium
strategy.

framework for establishing the quadratic termination property that covers the
Broyden family, the generalized PSB family, and good Broyden method. Based on
this framework, we employ operators to map the correction direction $s_k$ in
the quasi-Newton equation to a specific subspace, which ensures quadratic
termination for these three classes of methods without relying on exact line
searches. We derive the corresponding image and projection operators, analyze
their improved properties in matrix approximation, and design practical
algorithms accordingly. Preliminary numerical results show that the proposed
operator-based methods yield significant improvements in the performance of the
Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS),
Powell-Symmetric-Broyden (PSB), limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Broyden's
``good'' methods (BGM).

TL;DR: 研究风电场的联合规划与运营调度问题，提出基于决策依赖不确定性的两阶段分布鲁棒优化模型，并通过数值实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电的随机性和地理异质性导致分散风电场的波动可以部分抵消，从而影响总发电量的分布（平滑效应）。如何有效利用这一效应需要战略性的容量分配，但引入了决策依赖的不确定性。

Method: 提出一个两阶段分布鲁棒优化模型，使用决策依赖的Wasserstein模糊集，将分布和半径建模为规划决策的函数。模型被重构为混合整数二阶锥规划，并通过约束生成方法提高计算效率。

Result: 数值实验验证了解决方案框架的有效性，并证明了所提模型的优越性能。最优目标值提供了样本外性能的概率保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型和方法能够有效处理风电规划中的决策依赖不确定性，显著提高计算效率，并在实际数据中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study a joint wind farm planning and operational scheduling problem under
decision-dependent uncertainty. The objective is to determine the optimal
number of wind turbines at each location to minimize total cost, including both
investment and operational expenses. Due to the stochastic nature and
geographical heterogeneity of wind power, fluctuations across dispersed wind
farms can partially offset one another, thereby influencing the distribution of
aggregated wind power generation-a phenomenon known as the smoothing effect.
Effectively harnessing this effect requires strategic capacity allocation,
which introduces decision-dependent uncertainty into the planning process. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage distributionally robust
optimization model with a decision-dependent Wasserstein ambiguity set, in
which both the distribution and the radius are modeled as functions of the
planning decisions, reflecting the statistical characteristics of wind power
resources. Then, we reformulate the model as a mixed-integer second-order cone
program, and the optimal objective value provides a probabilistic guarantee on
the out-of-sample performance. To improve computational efficiency, we develop
a constraint generation based solution framework that accelerates the solution
procedure by hundreds of times. Numerical experiments using different datasets
validate the effectiveness of the solution framework and demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NASA的SPLICE项目需要一种能够处理状态触发约束的6-DoF动力下降制导算法，DQG算法被选为候选方案，但需要开发实时求解器以实现机载应用。

Method: 开发了SeCO框架，结合了序列凸规划和一阶锥优化，并基于PIPG方法实现了一阶原始对偶锥优化求解器。

Result: SeCO在NASA的硬件在环测试中表现优于之前的BSOCP求解器，首次满足并超过了NASA的实时更新率要求。

Conclusion: SeCO证明了其在计算受限的飞行硬件上实时处理关键任务应用的可行性。

Abstract: The dual quaternion guidance (DQG) algorithm was selected as the candidate
6-DoF powered-descent guidance algorithm for NASA's Safe and Precise Landing --
Integrated Capabilities Evolution (SPLICE) project. DQG is capable of handling
state-triggered constraints that are of utmost importance in terms of enabling
technologies such as terrain relative navigation. In this work, we develop a
custom solver for DQG to enable onboard implementation for future rocket
landing missions. We describe the design and implementation of a
real-time-capable optimization framework, called sequential conic optimization
(SeCO), that blends together sequential convex programming and first-order
conic optimization to solve difficult nonconvex trajectory optimization
problems, such as DQG, in real-time. A key feature of SeCO is that it leverages
a first-order primal-dual conic optimization solver, based on the
proportional-integral projected gradient method (PIPG). We describe the
implementation of this solver, develop customizable first-order methods, and
leverage convergence-accelerating strategies such as warm-starting and
extrapolation, to solve the nonconvex DQG optimal control problem in real-time.
Finally, in preparation for an upcoming closed-loop flight test campaign, we
test our custom solver onboard the NASA SPLICE Descent and Landing Computer in
a hardware-in-the-loop setting. We observe that our algorithm is significantly
faster than previously reported solve-times using the flight-tested interior
point method-based subproblem solver, BSOCP. Furthermore, our custom solver
meets (and exceeds) NASA's autonomous precision rocket-landing guidance
update-rate requirements for the first time, thus demonstrating the viability
of SeCO for real-time, mission-critical applications onboard
computationally-constrained flight hardware.

Motivation: 现有方法要求所有智能体渐近收敛到相同的位置和姿态，限制了在需要保持不同相对配置的场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 通过数值实验验证了所提解决方案的有效性，为多智能体系统的位置和姿态协调提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: This paper studies the integrated position and attitude control problem for
multi-agent systems of 3D rigid bodies. While the state-of-the-art method in
[Olfati-Saber and Murray, 2004] established the theoretical foundation for
rigid-body formation control, it requires all agents to asymptotically converge
to identical positions and attitudes, limiting its applicability in scenarios
where distinct desired relative configurations must be maintained. In this
paper, we develop a novel dual-quaternion-based framework that generalizes this
paradigm. By introducing a unit dual quaternion directed graph (UDQDG)
representation, we derive a new control law through the corresponding Laplacian
matrix, enabling simultaneous position and attitude coordination while
naturally accommodating directed interaction topologies. Leveraging the recent
advances in UDQDG spectral theory, we prove global asymptotic convergence to
desired relative configurations modulo a right-multiplicative constant and
establish an R-linear convergence rate determined by the second smallest
eigenvalue of the UDQDG Laplacian. A projected iteration method is proposed to
compute the iterative states. Finally, the proposed solution is verified by
several numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的线性规划问题类别和算法，能够高效计算无穷Wasserstein距离和概率测度的投影，解决了现有方法的计算复杂性和算法不足的问题。

Abstract: Computing the infinity Wasserstein distance and retrieving projections of a
probability measure onto a closed subset of probability measures are critical
sub-problems in various applied fields. However, the practical applicability of
these objects is limited by two factors: either the associated quantities are
computationally prohibitive or there is a lack of available algorithms capable
of calculating them. In this paper, we propose a novel class of Linear
Programming problems and a routine that allows us to compute the infinity
Wasserstein distance and to compute a projection of a probability measure over
a generic subset of probability measures with respect to any $p$-Wasserstein
distance with $p\in[1,\infty]$.

Conclusion: 本文提供了在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中，关于转移核和观测核扰动的显式和统一的性能界限，为模型简化提供了明确的性能保证。

Abstract: Studying the stability of partially observed Markov decision processes
(POMDPs) with respect to perturbations in either transition or observation
kernels is a mathematically and practically important problem. While asymptotic
robustness/stability results showing that as approximate transition kernels
and/or measurement kernels converge to the true ones in appropriate senses have
been previously reported, explicit and uniform bounds on value differences and
mismatch costs have not been studied to our knowledge. In this paper, we
provide such explicit bounds under both discounted and average cost criteria.
The bounds are given in terms of Wasserstein and total variation distances
between the original and approximate transition kernels, and total variation
distances between observation channels. In particular, we show that control
policies optimized for approximate models yield performance guarantees when
applied to the true model with explicit bounds. As a particular application, we
consider the case where the state space and the measurement spaces are
quantized to obtain finite models, and we obtain explicit error bounds which
decay to zero as the approximations get finer. This provides explicit
performance guarantees for model reduction in POMDPs.

Result: 在德国电力系统模型中，计算时间减少高达60%，内存需求降低，进一步优化后计算时间减少超过80%。

Conclusion: 时间分割的Benders分解方法有效提升了随机扩展规划问题的求解效率，适用于大规模能源系统优化。

Abstract: Stochastic programming can be applied to consider uncertainties in energy
system optimization models for capacity expansion planning. However, these
models become increasingly large and time-consuming to solve, even without
considering uncertainties. For two-stage stochastic capacity expansion planning
problems, Benders decomposition is often applied to ensure that the problem
remains solvable. Since stochastic scenarios can be optimized independently
within subproblems, their optimization can be parallelized. However,
hourly-resolved capacity expansion planning problems typically have a larger
temporal than scenario cardinality. Therefore, we present a temporally split
Benders decomposition that further exploits the parallelization potential of
stochastic expansion planning problems. A compact reformulation of the storage
level constraint into linking variables ensures that long-term storage
operation can still be optimized despite the temporal decomposition. We
demonstrate this novel approach with model instances of the German power system
with up to 87 million rows and columns. Our results show a reduction in
computing times of up to 60% and reduced memory requirements. Additional
enhancement strategies and the use of distributed memory on high-performance
computers further improve the computing time by over 80%.

Result: 与传统混合方法相比，ShellFT能够将多样化成本降低70%以上。

Conclusion: ShellFT框架通过选择性混合，显著降低了多样化成本，并提供了更高的灵活性，适用于不同用例的特定需求。

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when

workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability
models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,

Abstract: Particle-based simulations and point-cloud applications generate massive,

Traditional compression techniques struggle with irregular particle

GPZ consistently and significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art GPU

TL;DR: A novel PP-ANNS solution improves privacy, efficiency, and accuracy by using distance comparison encryption and a privacy-preserving index, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing PP-ANNS solutions, which fail to simultaneously meet privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user involvement requirements.

Method: The method involves a novel encryption technique called distance comparison encryption, a privacy-preserving index combining state-of-the-art k-ANNS with approximate distance computation, and a filter-and-refine search strategy.

Result: The solution accelerates PP-ANNS by up to 3 orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the challenges of privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user involvement in PP-ANNS, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In the era of cloud computing and AI, data owners outsource ubiquitous
vectors to the cloud, which furnish approximate $k$-nearest neighbors
($k$-ANNS) services to users. To protect data privacy against the untrusted
server, privacy-preserving $k$-ANNS (PP-ANNS) on vectors has been a fundamental
and urgent problem. However, existing PP-ANNS solutions fall short of meeting
the requirements of data privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user
involvement concurrently. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel
solution that primarily executes PP-ANNS on a single cloud server to avoid the
heavy communication overhead between the cloud and the user. To ensure data
privacy, we introduce a novel encryption method named distance comparison
encryption, facilitating secure, efficient, and exact distance comparisons. To
optimize the trade-off between data privacy and search performance, we design a
privacy-preserving index that combines the state-of-the-art $k$-ANNS method
with an approximate distance computation method. Then, we devise a search
method using a filter-and-refine strategy based on the index. Moreover, we
provide the security analysis of our solution and conduct extensive experiments
to demonstrate its superiority over existing solutions. Based on our
experimental results, our method accelerates PP-ANNS by up to 3 orders of
magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, while not compromising the
accuracy.

processes, since many companies are hesitant to share their data. In this
paper, we explore the processes of German state parliaments that are often
legally required to share their data and run the same type of processes for
different geographical regions. This paper is the first attempt to apply
process mining to parliamentary processes and, therefore, contributes toward a
novel interdisciplinary research area that combines political science and
process mining. In our case study, we analyze legislative processes of three
German state parliaments and generate insights into their differences and best
practices. We provide a discussion of the relevance of our results that are
based on knowledge exchange with a political scientist and a domain expert from
the German federal parliament.

### [231] [Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460)
*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRMMA和MMA方法，分别用于稀疏轨迹的恢复和地图匹配，显著提高了数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的轨迹数据通常稀疏且与路网不对齐，影响应用性能，因此需要高质量的数据恢复方法。

Method: TRMMA通过双Transformer编码和有效解码技术恢复轨迹；MMA通过分类任务和嵌入技术实现地图匹配。

Result: 在四个大型真实数据集上，TRMMA和MMA在轨迹恢复和地图匹配任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: TRMMA和MMA方法显著提升了稀疏轨迹的恢复和地图匹配的准确性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ASPEN+扩展了ASPEN系统，支持局部合并和新的最优解标准，提高了实体解析的准确性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASPEN系统仅支持全局合并，而局部合并在某些场景下更合适，如不同实例的'J. Lee'可能指向不同实体。

Method: ASPEN+引入了局部合并功能，并提出了新的最优解标准，如最小化规则违反或最大化支持合并的规则数量。

Result: 实验表明，局部合并和新最优解标准在真实数据集上显著提升了准确性和运行效率。

Conclusion: ASPEN+通过支持局部合并和优化解选择标准，为实体解析提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

Motivation: 现有的DBMS集成解决方案无法计算Emerging Skycube，且新兴数据立方体通常只支持单一度量，无法满足多标准决策分析的需求。因此，需要一种新的方法来高效处理多属性数据并减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 本文提出了一种结合Skycube和新兴数据立方体的方法，通过多标准决策分析和趋势反转发现来提取和分析数据。具体包括Skycube的无损部分物化以及封闭Emerging Skycube或封闭Emerging L-Skycube的减少方法。

Result: 提出的Emerging Skycube方法显著减少了计算时间和存储空间的需求，同时支持多标准决策分析。通过两种减少方法，进一步优化了性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Emerging Skycube概念，结合了Skycube和新兴数据立方体的优势，通过多标准决策分析和趋势反转发现，实现了全局最优数据的提取和分析。通过两种连续的减少方法，显著降低了计算时间和存储空间的需求。

Abstract: Combining multi-criteria decision analysis and trend reversal discovery make
it possible to extract globally optimal, or non-dominated, data in relation to
several criteria, and then to observe their evolution according to a
decision-making property. Thus, we introduce Emerging Skycube, a concept
associating Skycube and emerging datacube. As far as we know, no
DBMS-integrated solution exists to compute an emerging Skycube, and hence
taking advantage of ROLAP analysis tools. An emerging datacube has only one
measure: we propose to use several to comply to multi-criteria decision
analysis constraints which requires multiple attributes. A datacube is
expensive to compute. An emerging datacube is about twice as expensive. On the
other hand, an emerging Skycube is cheaper as the trend reversal is computed
after two Skycube calculations, which considerably reduces the relation volume
in comparison with the initial one. It is possible to save even more computing
time and storage space. To this end, we propose two successive reductions.
First, a Skycube lossless partial materialisation using Skylines concepts
lattice, based on the agree concepts lattice and partitions lattice. Then,
either the closed emerging Skycube for an information-loss reduction, or the
closed emerging L-Skycube for a smaller but lossless reduction.

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源工具，通过公开数据提供高精度的英超梦幻联赛球员表现预测，其准确性媲美商业服务，并在高回报球员预测上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业预测服务依赖专有数据和封闭模型，限制了高精度预测的普及。OpenFPL旨在通过开源方法和公开数据，让更多人获得准确的球员表现预测。

Method: OpenFPL采用位置特定的集成模型，基于2020-21至2023-24赛季的英超梦幻联赛和Understat数据优化，并在2024-25赛季数据上进行前瞻性测试。

Result: OpenFPL在1至3个比赛周的预测中，准确性媲美领先的商业服务，且在高回报球员（>2分）预测上表现更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL通过开源方法实现了高精度预测，支持长期转会策略和短期决策，为玩家提供了公平的竞争环境。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Motivation: 表格数据的推断在现代技术和科学中至关重要，但现有最佳实践（如GBDTs）多年来变化不大。最近，基于神经网络和特征学习的新方法重新受到关注。

Method: xRFM结合了特征学习核机器与树结构，既能适应数据的局部结构，又能扩展到无限量的训练数据。

Result: xRFM在100个回归数据集上表现最佳，在200个分类数据集上与最佳方法竞争，优于GBDTs。

Conclusion: xRFM是一种高效且可解释的表格数据推断方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球普遍缺乏身体活动的问题，探索mHealth干预（特别是JITAIs）在个性化促进身体活动中的潜力。

Method: 13,463名Fitbit用户被随机分为四组（控制组、随机组、固定组和RL组），RL组通过强化学习算法选择行为科学启发的提示。

Result: RL组在1个月和2个月时的步数显著高于其他组（如1个月时比控制组多296步）。

Conclusion: 行为科学启发的强化学习方法在个性化数字健康干预中具有潜力。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Conclusion: 本文提出需要进一步研究在生产系统中部署的模型的预测稳定性，尤其是集成模型在保持稳定性的同时不显著降低（甚至提高）预测准确性的能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法首次解决了扩散语言模型的约束解码问题，适用于形式语言，且在实际应用中表现出色，计算效率高。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Motivation: 探索D-Wave量子退火器在RBM采样中的表现，以验证其是否能为对比散度学习提供更高质量的样本。

Method: 采用局部谷（LV）中心方法评估受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）的采样质量，比较D-Wave和Gibbs采样在不同训练时期的性能。

Result: D-Wave采样在某些情况下覆盖了更多的局部谷，但与Gibbs采样的重叠性较低，尤其在训练后期。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，D-Wave量子退火器在采样质量上未能显著优于Gibbs采样，但揭示了结合经典与量子方法的潜在改进空间。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Motivation: IoMT设备资源受限且异构，传统集中式IDS存在延迟、隐私风险和漏洞增加的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多层次框架，第一层（近边缘）使用元学习或OCC算法粗粒度过滤流量，后续层（远边缘、云）识别攻击类型和新颖性。

Result: 在CICIoMT2024数据集上达到99.77%准确率和97.8% F1分数，第一层能高精度检测零日攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中表现出强适用性，尤其适合资源受限设备，且无需新数据集即可检测零日攻击。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中提高了计算效率（tokens/sec），同时性能与基线ReFT相当。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT通过优化计算效率和梯度更新偏差，为高成本推理任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Method: 使用旋转等角紧框架分类器和伪标签方法预训练深度编码器，结合生成式预训练任务和新的序列增强策略，以捕捉时间动态并增强嵌入可分性。

Result: 在三个多元时间序列分类数据集上，该方法显著优于之前的预训练任务，适用于LSTM、Transformer和状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将预训练目标与理论支持的嵌入几何对齐，能够显著提升时间序列分类的性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Motivation: 探索SAM在更一般的张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM在张量化模型中的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念，并基于梯度流分析其演化。

Result: 实验证明DAS在多个任务中性能优于SAM，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为，提供了一种高效且性能优越的优化方法。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

Motivation: To develop an accurate and explainable OOD detection method that leverages feature distance to decision boundaries, addressing the computational expense of large architectures.

Method: A post-hoc OOD detection method that calculates the distance to decision boundaries using counterfactual explanations, with strategies to improve scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.

Result: Achieved 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95 on CIFAR-10, outperformed state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100 (97.05% AUROC, 13.79% FPR95) and ImageNet-200 (92.55% AUROC, 33.55% FPR95).

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in OOD detection across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-200, while maintaining explainability through counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Conclusion: 论文建议采取措施减少或避免混杂因素，以提升推荐系统的实际效果。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of

rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single

state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution

non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package

Result: 在总体水平上，不平衡初始权重下回归参数线性收敛（O(log(1/ε))步），平衡初始权重下亚线性收敛（O(ε⁻²)步）。在有限样本水平上，不平衡权重下统计精度为O((d/n)¹/²)，平衡权重下为O((d/n)¹/⁴)。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了EM算法在过拟合混合线性回归中的收敛行为，并建立了总体水平与有限样本水平结果之间的联系，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from

$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using

that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种可解释的机器学习模型，用于早期预测肝硬化重症患者的急性肾损伤（AKI），LightGBM表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者中AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且难以融入ICU工作流程。

Method: 回顾性分析MIMIC-IV数据库，使用多种算法（如LightGBM、XGBoost）训练模型，评估指标包括AUROC、准确性等。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最佳（AUROC 0.808），关键预测因子包括凝血时间延长、低pH值等。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确分层AKI风险，高阴性预测值有助于临床决策，未来需外部验证和系统集成。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了上下文学习（ICL）在密码函数学习中的应用，特别是单字母替换和Vigenère密码，展示了Transformer模型在结构化推理任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是将ICL扩展到密码学领域，评估Transformer模型在推断隐藏映射关系时的归纳偏差和泛化能力。

Method: 通过少量（密文，明文）对，让模型推断出密码的替换规则，并解码新密文。

Result: 模型能够成功推断出单字母替换和Vigenère密码的隐藏映射关系。

Conclusion: 研究表明ICL在密码函数学习中具有潜力，为Transformer模型的推理能力提供了新的评估场景。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPMI是一种无需重新训练、不改变模型架构的后门攻击方法，通过剪枝和注入恶意头部实现高隐蔽性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法通常需要重新训练或修改模型架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强。

Method: HPMI通过剪枝最不重要的头部并注入预训练的恶意头部来建立后门。

Result: 实验表明HPMI在保持清洁准确率的同时，攻击成功率达99.55%，并能绕过四种先进防御机制。

Conclusion: HPMI在隐蔽性、鲁棒性和攻击效果上优于现有方法，且对模型性能影响极小。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating

to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的自适应资源编排方法，通过异构角色建模和奖励塑造机制，显著提升了云原生数据库系统的资源利用率和调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云原生数据库系统面临高资源动态性和调度复杂性的挑战，传统方法难以有效应对。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习，引入异构角色建模机制和奖励塑造机制，结合局部观测与全局反馈。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在资源利用率、调度延迟、策略收敛速度等方面优于传统方法，具有强泛化能力和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂调度环境中表现出色，适用于大规模实际应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线学习方法无法有效利用重复偏移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单个源组件，导致适应效果不佳。

Method: 通过EM算法离线分解源组件并学习预测模型，然后通过在线凸优化更新混合权重。

Result: 在多个真实回归数据集上，累积测试损失降低了高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用偏移特性，在适应性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有确定性方法无法同时建模生物变异性和功能一致性的问题。

Method: SynBrain 包含两个关键组件：BrainVAE（通过概率学习建模神经表示）和 Semantic-to-Neural Mapper（作为语义传输路径）。

Result: SynBrain 在视觉到 fMRI 编码性能上超越现有方法，并能高效适应新受试者，合成高质量的 fMRI 信号。

Conclusion: SynBrain 是一个生成框架，通过概率学习和生物可解释的方式模拟视觉语义到神经响应的转换，显著提升了视觉到 fMRI 编码的性能，并揭示了跨试验和受试者的功能一致性。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that uses knowledge-enhanced initialization and bi-level optimization to improve adaptation to new healthcare tasks, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable healthcare institutions to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases while preserving privacy and leveraging past experiences.

Method: FedKEI employs a global clustering process and a bi-level optimization scheme to personalize knowledge transfer for new tasks, optimizing inter-cluster and intra-cluster weights.

Result: FedKEI shows significant advantages in adapting to new diseases compared to existing methods, as validated on dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI demonstrates superior performance in adapting to new diseases by leveraging cross-client and cross-task knowledge transfer, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: CLIP-Fed 利用视觉语言预训练模型的零样本学习能力，通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型和CLIP的知识。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Fed 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT数据集上平均降低了攻击成功率（ASR），并提高了模型准确率（MA）。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed 是一种有效的联邦学习后门防御框架，通过结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，显著降低了攻击成功率并提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心聚类方法能更有效地实现公平性，且在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Motivation: Mamba模型在边缘设备上的部署缺乏优化的硬件加速框架，限制了其应用潜力。

Method: eMamba通过替换复杂归一化层、近似昂贵操作（如SiLU激活和指数运算），并进行近似感知的神经架构搜索（NAS）来优化模型。

Result: eMamba在多个数据集上表现出色，参数更少，延迟更低，吞吐量更高，且功耗和能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: eMamba为边缘设备上的Mamba模型部署提供了高效且准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估框架，无法验证其是否真正捕捉个体倾向并提供有意义的解释。

Method: 提出两个新指标：DIC（量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力）和BAE（评估模型解释与标注者行为的一致性）。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了ITL评估的空白，为理解标注者行为提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

Result: XQuant实现了高达7.7倍的内存节省，且困惑度下降小于0.1；XQuant-CL进一步实现高达12.5倍的内存节省，困惑度下降仅为0.1。

Conclusion: XQuant通过低比特量化和跨层相似性利用，显著减少了LLM推理的内存消耗，同时保持了接近FP16的精度，超越了现有的KV缓存量化方法。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能完全捕捉StarCraft II的复杂性，如完整游戏上下文、多样化动作空间和所有可玩种族。

Method: 提出SC2Arena基准测试和StarEvolve分层框架，包括Planner-Executor-Verifier结构和高质量训练样本选择评分系统。

Result: 实验结果表明StarEvolve在战略规划中表现优异，SC2Arena为开发通用智能体提供了新见解。

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve填补了现有基准测试的不足，为复杂决策任务提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保持特征间的复杂依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过手工约束或领域知识强制特征间依赖关系，限制了其泛化能力，且难以捕捉数据中的复杂非线性关系。此外，这些方法很少考虑用户偏好，生成的反事实解释可能因果不成立或不可行。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实和反事实实例的特征对的联合分布，自动保持复杂特征间依赖关系，无需显式领域知识。用户还可以冻结不希望更改的属性。

Result: 在三个合成和两个真实数据集上的评估表明，RealAC在因果边缘得分、依赖保持得分和IM1现实性指标上优于现有方法，包括基于大型语言模型的技术。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知和用户中心的反事实生成解决方案，平衡了现实性和可操作性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: X-Node是一种自解释的图神经网络框架，通过生成每个节点的解释来提高透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在临床应用中缺乏可解释性，现有方法多为事后全局解释，无法提供局部推理的细节。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重构嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到消息传递中。

Result: X-Node在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上保持分类准确性，同时生成忠实于节点的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node在保持性能的同时提高了GNN的可解释性，适用于高风险的临床场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG 优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG 通过分层生成对抗网络和互信息引导机制，有效解决了联邦图学习中类别不平衡的问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户间差异导致准确性下降，频繁校准限制了实际应用。

Method: EDAPT先训练多用户数据的基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT比静态方法更准确，且运行高效。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，减少了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用连续时间动态系统从任意观测数据创建世界模型的新技术，通过结合序列嵌入和神经常微分方程（神经ODE），构建了一个组织良好的潜在状态空间。该方法在简单摆系统上仅使用图像数据就生成了结构化的潜在状态空间模型，为开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Motivation: ReLU网络的梯度解释存在噪声和难以解释的问题，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过牺牲忠实性来平滑解释。

Method: 使用频谱框架分析和量化ReLU网络的高频信息贡献，并通过正则化方法识别平滑性与忠实性的权衡。

Result: 论文量化了基于代理的平滑方法对解释的扭曲，提出了“解释差距”的概念，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入一个统一的频谱框架，系统地分析和量化了ReLU网络解释中的平滑性、忠实性及其权衡，并验证了理论发现。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four

Motivation: 现实多模态应用需要灵活的跨模态理解和生成能力，但现有方法在灵活性和扩展性上存在局限。

Method: MAGUS采用两阶段设计（Cognition和Deliberation），结合多智能体协作和Growth-Aware Search机制，无需联合训练即可实现灵活的跨模态转换。

Conclusion: MAGUS框架通过模块化设计和多智能体协作，成功实现了跨模态的理解与生成，且在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越了GPT-4o。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升非平衡非局部蒙特卡洛算法的性能，为组合优化问题提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Conclusion: PCD在提高耦合效果和保证约束满足的同时，计算成本较低。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets

Motivation: 解决长时程强化学习中奖励稀疏性问题，避免现有方法因奖励不对齐导致的策略退化。

Method: 提出SWE-oriented RL Framework和G-RA方法，通过门控机制累积即时奖励，确保奖励与长期目标对齐。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和kBench上，任务完成率和修改率显著提升（47.6%→93.8%和22.0%→86.0%；19.6%→23.8%和12.0%→42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长时程强化学习中实现了平衡的奖励累积，为软件工程任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中因分布偏移导致的模型泛化能力不足问题，支持不同架构模型的参数共享和知识迁移。

Method: 提出unified learning范式，将不同模型编码为图表示，并在共享图学习空间中通过uGNN进行优化。

Result: 在MorphoMNIST和MedMNIST基准测试中，unified learning在分布偏移情况下表现出色，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Unified learning通过将不同模型统一到共享的图学习空间中，并通过uGNN优化，显著提升了模型在分布偏移情况下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Conclusion: GATs方法有效解决了上采样问题，避免了传统方法的局限性，并在实际应用中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Conclusion: FreeGAD 是一种无需训练的高效图异常检测方法，通过利用亲和门控残差编码器和锚节点引导的统计偏差，在多个基准数据集上表现出卓越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: 通过概率和谱视角的形式化分析，揭示了梯度方法中的谱偏差，并提出了两种改进方法：标准扰动尺度的确定机制和SpectralLens聚合方法。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Method: 利用IRT参数对数据集进行划分，并在四个表格数据集上评估了多种机器学习模型的性能。

Result: IRT揭示了实例的异质性，并发现高猜测参数的实例会显著降低模型性能。

Conclusion: IRT-informed分区策略能更有效地评估模型性能，并帮助理解模型的偏差-方差权衡。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Conclusion: 新方法通过物理归纳偏置和统计力学基础，显著提升了ΔΔG预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB模型在实验中表现最佳，且不依赖捷径学习。

Conclusion: MCIB模型在不依赖捷径学习的情况下实现了最佳性能，为多模态讽刺检测提供了一种有效的模态融合方法。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过结合空间持久同源性和空间约束优化模块，显著提升了空间转录组数据的聚类性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

Result: 在12个大都市区的实验中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时，其平均绝对误差（MAE）低于基线模型（假设无变化）。这表明生成模型能够捕捉历史数据中的时空模式，对未来变化预测具有显著意义。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在土地覆盖变化预测中具有潜力，未来研究将进一步结合地球物理属性和驱动变量，以支持不同情景的模拟。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Motivation: 现有防御措施（如主机补丁和网络过滤）在可扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在问题，无法有效应对1天或n天漏洞的威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（RL）驱动在线网络奖励，结合Agentic RAG知识蒸馏、RL From VNF管道和在线代理验证，训练LLM生成网络过滤器。

Result: 在22类漏洞测试中，REFN准确性提高21.1%，平均补丁时间为3.65小时，可扩展至10K设备。

Conclusion: REFN是训练LLM快速预防大规模漏洞利用的初步尝试，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Method: 使用开源电磁仿真软件gprMax，结合GPU加速，生成大量天线仿真数据，并比较不同机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 入门级GPU性能优于高端CPU，高端游戏GPU性能可达高端CPU的18倍；开源软件在足够精细的空间分辨率下与商业软件结果相似。

Conclusion: GPU加速的天线仿真框架能高效生成数据集，适用于机器学习应用，且开源软件在特定条件下可与商业软件媲美。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Conclusion: APFL通过双流最小二乘法解决了PFL中的非IID数据问题，实现了集体泛化和个体个性化的平衡，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Result: Pass@k训练提升了模型的探索能力，探索与利用可以相互增强，且优势函数设计显示出潜在的研究价值。

Conclusion: 本文通过使用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型，发现其探索能力有所提升，并推导出Pass@k训练的优势解析解。分析表明，探索与利用并非固有冲突目标，而是可以相互增强。此外，Pass@k训练本质上涉及直接设计优势函数，为RLVR的未来研究方向提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: 结合Erwin架构与Native Sparse Attention（NSA）机制，成功提升了Transformer模型在大规模物理系统中的效率和感受野，解决了注意力机制二次复杂度的问题。

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

TL;DR: IBEX是一种基于信息瓶颈理论的粗到细管道，用于解决蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺问题，显著提高了药物设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前三维生成模型在药物发现中受限于公开可用的蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺，导致模型过拟合训练集偏差。

Method: IBEX利用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务和L-BFGS优化步骤，生成并优化分子构象。

Result: IBEX将零样本对接成功率从53%提高到64%，平均Vina得分从-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}提升到-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}，并在57/100口袋中取得最佳Vina能量。

Conclusion: IBEX通过改进信息利用和优化步骤，显著提升了药物设计的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Motivation: 现实应用（如医疗和推荐系统）中的多臂老虎机问题通常具有非平稳动态特性，传统算法难以应对。

Method: 结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态变化的状态转移。

Result: 算法在非平稳环境下实现了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 首次为非平稳多臂老虎机问题提供了理论基础和有效算法。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种交互式验证范式，用于解决数据归因方法中的信任问题，确保资源受限的验证者能够高效且可靠地验证数据归因的准确性。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计虽然能提高效率，但缺乏实验先验知识可能导致违反隐含约束，例如在GuacaMol基准测试中，超过60%的分子可能具有高致突变性。

Method: 通过LLM管道从文献中提取实验室使用的化合物信息，构建包含3200万对自然语言事实和实体表示的数据集\ourdataset，并训练LLM、CLIP和LLava架构进行联合推理。

Result: 使用\ourdataset预训练的模型（1500万参数）在TDC任务中表现优于20亿参数的TxGemma，并与90亿参数的模型相当，同时在GuacaMol中生成更安全的分子。

Conclusion: \ourdataset能有效提升模型性能，生成更安全的分子设计，数据集已公开并计划随着文献增长而扩展。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习（FL）与差分隐私（DP）结合时隐私与临床效用之间的权衡问题，尤其是在医疗数据中常见的严重类别不平衡情况下。

Method: 通过多阶段分析，集成了SMOTETomek技术和优化的FedProx算法，以解决数据不平衡和非独立同分布（non-IID）问题。

Result: 优化后的FedProx算法在隐私预算（epsilon）和模型召回率之间表现出非线性权衡，并在epsilon为9.0时实现了高临床效用（召回率大于77%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为创建有效、安全且准确的诊断工具提供了实用的方法蓝图，适用于现实世界中异构的医疗数据。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Context Filtering模型能够显著降低LLMs的越狱攻击成功率（高达88%），同时保持其原有性能，是一种即插即用的方法，适用于所有LLMs。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

Conclusion: 结论指出认知安全是一个模型特定的工程问题，需要针对不同架构进行定制化测试和干预。

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究为构建智能、数据驱动的防御机制提供了基础，有助于从住宅端点加强智能电网的网络安全。

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new framework, ERDALT, is proposed for certifiably robust malware detection by design, addressing adversarial evasion without compromising functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of current machine-learning-based static malware analysis techniques to adversarial examples, which can evade detection without altering malware functionality.

Method: The paper introduces a new model architecture designed for certifiably robust malware detection and decomposes robust detectors into a specific structure. The framework ERDALT is built upon this structure.

Result: The results demonstrate that ERDALT enables robust malware detection with limited reduction in detection performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed framework ERDALT, based on a specific structure for robust malware detection, achieves certifiable robustness without significantly compromising detection performance.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

Motivation: 现有的多任务对抗文本攻击方法依赖于共享内部特征和大量查询，且通常局限于单一任务类型，难以应对实际场景中的黑盒反馈API、有限查询或多任务类型需求。

Method: CEMA利用深度级替代模型，以即插即用的方式训练文本分类模型，并通过生成多个对抗候选文本选择最有效的攻击方式。

Conclusion: CEMA是一种有效的黑盒攻击方法，能够通过少量查询实现多任务文本对抗攻击，适用于实际场景中的多种任务类型和商业API。

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

borders. This architecture combines (biometric and other) sensors, (established
and upcoming) identity authorities, attribute verifiers, and a new core
component we call the \emph{Personal Identity Agent (PIA)} that represents
individuals with their identity attributes in the digital domain. All
transactions are conducted in a completely decentralized manner, and the
components for which we currently assume central coordination are optional and
only used for assisting with service discovery and latency reduction. We
present a first protocol between these parties and formally verify that it
achieves relevant security properties based on a realistic threat model
including strong global adversaries. A proof-of-concept implementation
demonstrates practical feasibility of both architecture and initial protocol
for applications that can tolerate end-to-end latencies in the range of a few
seconds.

Conclusion: \Sys 是一个基于区块链的联邦学习中毒检测框架，通过分散全局服务器的角色并引入法官模型，有效抵御数据中毒攻击，同时具备可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

TL;DR: MAESTRO框架通过七层威胁建模架构暴露和消除AI代理的漏洞，验证了其在威胁映射和弹性系统设计中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与自主代理在网络监控和决策系统中会引发严重安全问题，需要研究解决方案。

Method: 使用Python、LangChain和WebSockets构建原型代理系统，包含推理、内存、参数调优和异常检测模块。

Result: 确认两种实际威胁案例：资源拒绝服务和内存中毒，导致性能下降。建议采用多层防御策略。

Conclusion: MAESTRO框架在威胁映射和弹性系统设计中有效，强调内存完整性和跨层通信保护的重要性。

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代能源管理系统面临动态的网络安全漏洞和系统问题，需要一种综合方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出多点攻击/错误模型和生成式AI异常检测系统，结合视觉标记和多模态分析（SoM-GI框架）。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上验证了框架的有效性，能够识别不一致性并保护系统免受威胁。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合数值分析和视觉模式识别，为EMS提供了全面的安全保障。

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘算法主要依赖训练中调整模型权重，缺乏对数据层面调整的探索，数字水印可能为遗忘过程带来新优势。

Method: 提出Water4MU框架，利用双层优化：上层优化水印网络以最小化遗忘难度，下层独立训练模型。

Result: Water4MU在图像分类和生成任务中有效，尤其在“挑战性遗忘”场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Water4MU通过数据水印和双层优化实现了高效机器遗忘，为敏感数据移除提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MineDetect的联邦学习防御框架，用于地下采矿中检测和隔离受攻击模型，并减少低质量数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下采矿中，传感器网络收集的数据涉及隐私和安全问题，联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但仍面临模型攻击和低质量数据的挑战。

Method: MineDetect通过历史感知机制检测受攻击模型，并识别和消除低质量数据对联邦学习的影响。

Result: 实验表明，MineDetect在鲁棒性和准确性上优于现有方法，尤其在非独立同分布数据场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MineDetect在提高地下采矿安全和操作效率方面具有重要意义，同时保持了较低的计算开销。

Abstract: Underground mining operations rely on distributed sensor networks to collect
critical data daily, including mine temperature, toxic gas concentrations, and
miner movements for hazard detection and operational decision-making. However,
transmitting raw sensor data to a central server for training deep learning
models introduces significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive
mine-specific information. Federated Learning (FL) offers a transformative
solution by enabling collaborative model training while ensuring that raw data
remains localized at each mine. Despite its advantages, FL in underground
mining faces key challenges: (i) An attacker may compromise a mine's local
model by employing techniques such as sign-flipping attacks or additive noise,
leading to erroneous predictions; (ii) Low-quality (yet potentially valuable)
data, caused by poor lighting conditions or sensor inaccuracies in mines may
degrade the FL training process. In response, this paper proposes MineDetect, a
defense FL framework that detects and isolates the attacked models while
mitigating the impact of mines with low-quality data. MineDetect introduces two
key innovations: (i) Detecting attacked models (maliciously manipulated) by
developing a history-aware mechanism that leverages local and global averages
of gradient updates; (ii) Identifying and eliminating adversarial influences
from unreliable models (generated by clients with poor data quality) on the FL
training process. Comprehensive simulations across diverse datasets demonstrate
that MineDetect outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy,
even in challenging non-IID data scenarios. Its ability to counter adversarial
influences while maintaining lower computational efficiency makes it a vital
advancement for improving safety and operational effectiveness in underground
mining.

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂动态网络环境中的现代入侵检测系统提供了统一高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are facing challenges in generalization and
robustness due to the heterogeneity of network traffic and the diversity of
attack patterns. To address this issue, we propose a new joint-dataset training
paradigm for IDS and propose a scalable BERTector framework based on BERT.
BERTector integrates three key components: NSS-Tokenizer for traffic-aware
semantic tokenization, supervised fine-tuning with a hybrid dataset, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient training. Extensive experiments show
that BERTector achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, strong
cross-dataset generalization capabilities, and excellent robustness to
adversarial perturbations. This work establishes a unified and efficient
solution for modern IDS in complex and dynamic network environments.

TL;DR: 论文反驳了USENIX Security 2025中关于MIRAGE随机缓存存在AES密钥泄漏漏洞的结论，指出其建模错误导致虚假结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证USENIX Security 2025中关于MIRAGE随机缓存存在AES密钥泄漏漏洞的结论是否正确。

Method: 通过重新模拟MIRAGE缓存，随机化每次运行的驱逐种子，以反映真实操作。

Result: 当驱逐种子随机化后，AES T-table访问与攻击者运行时间的相关性消失，攻击失败。

Conclusion: 报告的泄漏是由于建模错误导致的假象，MIRAGE实际上不存在漏洞。

Abstract: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 claims that occupancy-based
attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper,
we examine these claims and find that they arise from fundamental modeling
flaws. Most critically, the authors' simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed
to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE,
causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic
sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing
pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE,
where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead
randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the
correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and
the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact
of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

TL;DR: AlDBaran 是一种高性能认证数据库，通过优化技术显著提升区块链吞吐量，支持历史状态证明，并在性能上超越现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有认证数据库无法满足高吞吐量区块链系统的需求，尤其是在处理数百万 TPS 时。

Method: 通过消除磁盘 I/O 操作、实施预取策略和优化 Merkle 树的更新机制，AlDBaran 实现了高效的认证数据结构。

Result: AlDBaran 在 50 Gbps 的网络吞吐量下高效处理状态更新，支持历史状态证明，并在性能测试中表现出色（如 48 百万次更新/秒）。

Conclusion: AlDBaran 是一种高效的认证数据库，能够显著提升区块链系统的吞吐量，支持历史状态证明，并在性能和简单性上优于现有解决方案。

Abstract: The fundamental basis for maintaining integrity within contemporary
blockchain systems is provided by authenticated databases. Our analysis
indicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain
fail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing
transactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial
advancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from
the critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update
mechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data
structure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput
of 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically
documented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most
high-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.
  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a
wide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran
could enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to
offer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.
  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects,
AlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran
achieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an
identical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an
attractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data
capabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further
enhances performance. On consumer-level portable hardware, it achieves
approximately 8 million updates/s in an in-memory setting and 5 million
updates/s with snapshots at sub-second intervals, illustrating compelling and
cost-effective scalability.

Motivation: 为了将[DMR25]中提出的flowering IOPP协议从特定(2, n)-regular Tanner码扩展到更广泛的编码类型，尤其是基于Cayley图的编码。

Method: 通过利用Cayley图的良好扩展性质，将flowering IOPP协议推广到更广泛的编码类型。

Result: 提出的广义协议保持了较低的soundness参数，复杂度略有下降，适用于具有恒定率和最小距离的编码。

Conclusion: 该协议扩展了IOPP的应用范围，同时保持了良好的性能，为代码为基础的SNARKs提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity (IOPP) are at the heart of code-based
SNARKs, a family of zeroknowledge protocols. The first and most famous one is
the FRI protocol [BBHR18a], that efficiently tests proximity to Reed-Solomon
codes. This paper generalizes the flowering IOPP introduced in [DMR25] for some
specific (2, n)-regular Tanner codes to a much broader variety of codes: any
code with symbols indexed on the edges of a Cayley graph. The flowering
protocol of [DMR25] had a soundness parameter much lower than the FRI protocol
[BCI + 23], and complexity parameters that could compete with the FRI
[BBHR18a]. The lower soundness and the absence of restriction on the base field
may lead to other practical speedups, however the codes considered in [DMR25]
have an o(1) minimum distance. The generalization proposed in this paper
preserves the soundness parameter with a slight decrease of the complexity
parameters, while allowing being applied on codes with constant rate and
constant minimum distance thanks to the good expansion properties of some
families of Cayley graphs.

Motivation: IoT设备因资源受限易受DDoS攻击，传统检测方法难以应对IoT网络的动态性和攻击的多样性。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在检测IoT设备上的DDoS攻击方面表现出色，具有在实际IoT环境中部署的潜力。

Abstract: DDoS attacks have become a major threat to the security of IoT devices and
can cause severe damage to the network infrastructure. IoT devices suffer from
the inherent problem of resource constraints and are therefore susceptible to
such resource-exhausting attacks. Traditional methods for detecting DDoS
attacks are not efficient enough to cope with the dynamic nature of IoT
networks, as well as the scalability of the attacks, diversity of protocols,
high volume of traffic, and variability in device behavior, and variability of
protocols like MQTT, CoAP, making it hard to implement security across all the
protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., the use of
Transformer models, which have shown remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks, for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices. The proposed model
extracts features from network traffic data and processes them using a
self-attention mechanism. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning
techniques, which can be validated by comparing both approaches' accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study show that the
Transformer models can be an effective solution for detecting DDoS attacks on
IoT devices and have the potential to be deployed in real-world IoT
environments.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的 PIDS 易受图操纵攻击影响，缺乏鲁棒的检测解决方案，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 结合逻辑感知的多视图增强和对比表示学习，引入逻辑感知噪声注入（LNI）生成语义有效的图视图，并在逻辑保持对比学习框架中训练模型。

Conclusion: MirGuard 提供了一种针对图操纵攻击的鲁棒且有效的解决方案，显著提升了 PIDS 的对抗能力，同时保持了检测性能和效率。

Abstract: Learning-based Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have
become essential tools for anomaly detection in host systems due to their
ability to capture rich contextual and structural information, as well as their
potential to detect unknown attacks. However, recent studies have shown that
these systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers
manipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous
approaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it
with a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of
PIDSes.
  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection
framework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive
representation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural
perturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to
generate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations
preserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views
are then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which
encourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign
transformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against
various graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance
and efficiency. Our work represents the first targeted study to enhance PIDS
against such adversarial threats, providing a robust and effective solution to
modern cybersecurity challenges.

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合可解释人工智能（XAI）技术，提升了深度学习模型在恶意软件检测中的可解释性和可信度，特别是在动态恶意软件分析和分类任务中。

Abstract: Deep learning models are one of the security strategies, trained on extensive
datasets, and play a critical role in detecting and responding to these threats
by recognizing complex patterns in malicious code. However, the opaque nature
of these models-often described as "black boxes"-makes their decision-making
processes difficult to understand, even for their creators. This research
addresses these challenges by integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to
enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of malware detection models.
In this research, the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for dynamic malware
analysis has been considered, a less explored area, and its efficacy in
detecting Metamorphic Malware, and further the effectiveness and transparency
of MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and CNN-LSTM models in malware classification, evaluating
these models through the lens of Explainable AI (XAI). This comprehensive
approach aims to demystify the internal workings of deep learning models,
promoting a better understanding and trust in their predictive capabilities in
cybersecurity contexts. Such in-depth analysis and implementation haven't been
done to the best of our knowledge.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的CTI融合在推进自主安全操作和建立智能自适应网络安全框架方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于搜索的框架，通过模拟隐私关键代理交互来发现和改进攻击与防御策略，展示了在实际应用中构建隐私感知代理的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的广泛部署可能带来隐私威胁，恶意代理通过多轮交互提取敏感信息，动态对话的适应性攻击策略难以手动预测和发现。

Method: 采用搜索框架，通过模拟隐私关键代理交互（数据主体、数据发送者和数据接收者），利用LLM作为优化器进行并行搜索和跨线程传播，迭代改进攻击与防御指令。

Result: 攻击策略从简单直接请求升级为复杂的多轮策略（如冒充和伪造同意），防御策略从基于规则的约束发展为身份验证状态机，且这些策略在不同场景和模型中具有强实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效发现和改进隐私攻击与防御策略，为构建隐私感知代理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

### [333] [Rethinking Reliability Using Network Coding: a Practical 5G Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10247)
*Laura Landon,Vipindev Adat Vasudevan,Junmo Sung,Muriel Médard*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在5G测试床IP层集成实时网络编码的系统，替代传统的ARQ和HARQ重传机制，通过RLNC实现高效纠错，减少传输次数并保持高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重传机制（如ARQ和HARQ）在无线系统中效率较低，尤其是在高丢包率下。网络编码（如RLNC）可能提供更高效的可靠性解决方案。

Method: 在5G测试床中，通过基于netfilter的包拦截框架，在gNB和UE之间的实时流量中注入RLNC前向纠错，并评估块编码方案对吞吐量、抖动和资源使用的影响。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的码率时，RLNC能以比ARQ/HARQ更少的传输次数完全恢复丢包，并在中高丢包率下保持高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 网络编码（RLNC）可有效替代传统重传机制，提高未来无线系统的资源利用效率。

Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a real-time network
coding system integrated into the IP layer of a 5G testbed, offering an
alternative to conventional retransmission-based reliability mechanisms such as
ARQ and HARQ. Using a netfilter-based packet interception framework, we inject
forward erasure correction using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) into live
traffic between a gNB and UE over a 3GPP RF link. We evaluate a block coding
scheme, analyzing its impact on throughput, jitter, and resource usage. Results
show that with appropriate code rate selection, RLNC can fully recover from
packet losses using fewer transmissions than ARQ/HARQ and maintain a high
throughput, particularly under moderate-to-high packet loss rates. These
findings demonstrate that network coding can effectively replace
retransmission-based reliability in future wireless systems, with the potential
for more efficient resource utilization.

*Zekun Wang,Binghao Yue,Weitao Pan,Jiangyi Shi,Yue Hao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉动阵列和移位寄存器的混合架构硬件优先级队列，用于高效管理计时器队列，支持五种操作，并在FPGA上实现了400 MHz以上的运行频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模计时器在网络处理中广泛应用，但传统实现存在计时精度低和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 采用脉动阵列和移位寄存器的混合架构，结合集中式布尔逻辑编码和新颖的push-first操作。

Result: 在FPGA上实现了400 MHz以上的运行频率，资源消耗比现有技术减少了2.2-2.8倍。

Conclusion: 该设计首次实现了队列内优先级更新的硬件优先级队列，显著提升了计时器管理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large-scale timers are ubiquitous in network processing, including flow table
entry expiration control in software defined network (SDN) switches, MAC
address aging in Ethernet bridges, and retransmission timeout management in
TCP/IP protocols. Conventional implementations suffer from critical
limitations: low timing accuracy due to large-scale timer traversal and high
computational overhead for new timer insertion. This paper presents a
hybrid-architecture hardware priority queue based on systolic arrays and shift
registers for efficient timer queue management. The design uniquely supports
five operations: enqueue, dequeue, delete, update, and peek.To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first hardware priority queue enabling in-queue priority
updates. By leveraging centralized Boolean logic encoding within systolic
blocks, the design efficiently generates set/shift control signals while the
novel push-first operation ensures FIFO ordering for same-priority timers
without additional metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the design
operates at over 400 MHz on FPGAs, achieving a 2.2-2.8x reduction in resource
consumption compared to state-of-the-art implementations.

TL;DR: SSU系统利用Starlink基础设施优化地球观测卫星数据传输，减少数据积压。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星数据下载面临地面站数量有限和通信窗口短暂的挑战，而Starlink等新兴LEO星座提供了连续连接的可能性。

Method: 提出了一种名为“Starlink Space User”（SSU）的新型数据传递系统，包括链路和PoP选择算法以及系统调度优化。

Result: 通过跟踪驱动模拟和实际Starlink性能测量，证明SSU设计能显著减少每颗卫星的中位数数据积压。

Conclusion: 利用Starlink卫星基础设施支持地球观测卫星是可行的，SSU系统能显著减少数据积压。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are collecting
vast amounts of data, which are invaluable for applications such as monitoring
forest fires. However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant
challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief
communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like
Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for
ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink
satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated
as "Starlink Space User" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites.
SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient
data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms
designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization,
that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure. We assess
the performance of SSU using trace-driven simulations alongside real-world
Starlink performance measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
Starlink-aided design can significantly reduce the median backlog (data not
delivered) per satellite.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率延迟分析（PLA）方法，用于建模ROS 2 DDS通信的可靠传输过程，并通过实验验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，ROS 2 DDS的心跳周期、IP分段和重传间隔的紧密耦合导致端到端延迟行为不明确，缺乏参数调优的指导。

Method: 采用离散状态方法，系统分析中间件和传输层事件，计算未确认消息的稳态概率分布和重传延迟。

Result: 在270种场景下验证了PLA的准确性，展示了分析预测与实验结果的高度一致性。

Conclusion: PLA为无线工业机器人中可靠性、延迟和性能的系统优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在LoRa网络中因带宽限制、干扰和严格占空比约束带来的挑战。

Method: 开发了一个基于Python的模拟器，集成了Flower和LoRaSim框架，支持更新稀疏化、量化、压缩、FEC和占空比控制。

Result: 数值结果展示了传输参数和干扰对FL性能的影响，FEC对FL收敛和设备空中时间的影响。

Conclusion: FEC在LoRa网络中实现联邦学习的关键作用被证实，为通信协议设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over long-range (LoRa) low-power wide area networks
faces unique challenges due to limited bandwidth, interference, and strict
duty-cycle constraints. We develop a Python-based simulator that integrates and
extends the Flower and LoRaSim frameworks to evaluate centralized FL over LoRa
networks. The simulator employs a detailed link-level model for FL update
transfer over LoRa channels, capturing LoRa's receiver sensitivity,
interference characteristics, block-fading effects, and constraints on the
maximum transmission unit. It supports update sparsification, quantization,
compression, forward frame-erasure correction (FEC), and duty cycling.
Numerical results illustrate the impact of transmission parameters (spreading
factor, FEC rate) and interference on FL performance. Demonstrating the
critical role of FEC in enabling FL over LoRa networks, we perform an in-depth
evaluation of the impact of FEC on FL convergence and device airtime, providing
insights for communication protocol design for FL over LoRa networks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活方案，通过调整LoRa扩展因子和传输次数，实现固件更新中能量与延迟的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRaWAN终端设备通常受限于能量和传输周期限制，因此控制固件更新的能量消耗和交付延迟是关键挑战。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的方案，通过顺序使用LoRa扩展因子传输更新帧，并在每个扩展因子下发送固定数量的帧，以实现能量与延迟的权衡。

Result: 方案能够根据更新紧急程度，灵活选择低延迟高能耗或高延迟低能耗的设置。

Conclusion: 该方案通过调整LoRa扩展因子和传输次数，实现了能量消耗与交付延迟之间的可调权衡，适用于不同紧急程度的固件更新。

Abstract: Over-the-air firmware updates are crucial for mitigating security threats and
maintaining up-to-date device functionality in Long Range Wide Area Networks
(LoRaWANs). LoRaWAN end devices are usually energy-constrained, and LoRaWAN
transmissions are subject to duty-cycle restrictions. Consequently, controlling
the energy expenditure and update-delivery latency of FUOTA are key challenges.
We propose a flexible scheme that achieves a tunable trade-off between the
energy consumption and delivery delay. The scheme employs the LoRa spreading
factors sequentially to transmit update-carrying frames, sending a fixed number
of frames with a given spreading factor before moving to the next. By adjusting
the smallest spreading factor to be used and the number of transmissions per
spreading factor, a suitable energy-delay trade-off can be achieved. Thus,
time-sensitive updates, such as security patches, may be sent with a
low-delay-high-energy setting, whereas a more energy-efficient but higher-delay
setting may be used for non-critical updates.

Motivation: 由于ESN的参数选择和架构调整对性能影响复杂，且缺乏经验可能导致优化困难，因此需要理解这些因素对性能的具体影响。

Method: 通过四个不同领域的基准任务（时间序列预测、模式生成、混沌系统预测和时间序列分类）进行实验，分析ESN的性能变化。

Conclusion: 本文提出的启发式方法为ESN的配置和参数选择提供了实用指导，有助于初学者快速掌握ESN的应用。

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

Motivation: 解决部分标记数据中标记概率不均的问题，结合预测辅助推断与设计基调查方法。

Method: 使用Horvitz-Thompson或Hájek形式的逆概率加权（IPW）替换无偏校正项。

Result: 模拟显示，IPW调整的PPI在估计倾向时性能接近已知概率情况，保持覆盖率和方差减少优势。

Conclusion: IPW调整的PPI有效处理信息性标记问题，适用于标记概率未知但模型正确的情况。

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Motivation: 现代机器学习流水线需要在生产数据流上持续学习、遗忘和预测，而现有的机器遗忘工作假设静态、独立同分布的训练环境，不符合实际需求。

Method: 使用遗憾、样本复杂性和删除容量等概念，将批量遗忘场景转化为在线设置，并采用在线L-BFGS优化替代昂贵的Hessian逆运算。

Result: 首次实现了对数遗憾界$\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$，并通过优化算法减少了随时间线性增长的内存占用。

Conclusion: 该论文通过将批量遗忘场景转化为在线设置，并优化算法，显著提高了机器遗忘的效率，延长了模型的生命周期。

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

Motivation: 研究广义一阶迭代算法（包括梯度优化和AMP）在有限样本下的非渐近行为，填补传统AMP理论依赖渐近性和可分性的空白。

Method: 通过构造广义一阶方法与条件高斯过程的显式耦合，利用有限维状态演化递归确定协方差演化，直接比较两者行为。

Result: 在温和的Lipschitz和矩匹配条件下，获得了紧致的维度无关界限，并通过Wasserstein距离下界验证了上界的锐度。

Conclusion: 本文方法为高斯矩阵下的AMP理论提供了统一且不依赖渐近性或可分性的推导，扩展了非渐近分析的适用范围。

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of
generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based
optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian
data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result
constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized
first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance
evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion.
This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and
moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP
proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order
method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach
provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without
relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the
Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私PCA方法要么需要样本量随维度d超线性增长，要么在数据内在随机性较小时引入过多噪声，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的差分隐私算法，用于估计前k个主成分，适用于任意k ≤ d，且在样本量n = Õ(d)时仍能保持接近最优的统计误差。

Result: 新算法在k=1时与DP-PCA性能相当，在k>1时提供了接近最优的统计误差，并通过实验验证了其优于基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的差分隐私随机PCA算法，能够高效估计前k个主成分，克服了现有方法的局限性，并在理论和实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible and robust Conic Gromov-Wasserstein distance for comparing complex structures, with theoretical guarantees and efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, such as equal mass requirements and sensitivity to outliers, by proposing a more flexible and robust framework.

Method: The authors introduce a novel formulation of CGW in terms of semi-couplings, extend it beyond metric measure spaces, and develop a block coordinate ascent algorithm for estimation.

Result: The results include theoretical properties of CGW (scaling behavior, variational convergence, robustness bounds) and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance is a robust and scalable tool for comparing complex network and hypernetwork structures, with theoretical guarantees and practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare
probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an
important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as
ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as
the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to
outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW
distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned
with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by
S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in
terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure
space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures.
With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the
CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational
convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds
with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative
bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in
the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple
and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation,
and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our
approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and
structured datasets.
