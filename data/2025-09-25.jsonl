Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs.

Severe consequences may arise if\ndevelopers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks\ninto their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large\nlanguage models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community.\nHowever, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code,\nincluding fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data,\nall of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this\npaper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these\ninherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven\npotential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code,\nand continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in\nLLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows,\nwhile some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the\nsecurity of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and\nseverity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on\nSSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four\npopular LLMs from GPT and Llama.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale.

We focus on a typical\nmulti-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge\nservers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that\nclients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple\nESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed\nmodels, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the\nupdated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of\neach ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which\nindirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process,\nmaking it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments.

This\nframework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in\ndifferent real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have\nnon-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,\nand why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We\napply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for\nimproving model training.

At inference, the model\ncombines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch\nsignal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a\nsingle score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and\nPSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with\nparticular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show\ncomplementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around\nregime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a\ncalibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate\nsystems.

In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput.

The current\nliterature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware\nintelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT\nthreats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly\ndetection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware\nlabeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine\nlearning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm.\nAccording to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU-\naccelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of\nhigh recall and strong classification performance."}

Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation\nenvironments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on\nsimplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that\ndo not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change\nprediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the\npractical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often\nunder-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction\nthrough a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights\nthat emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical\nchallenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational\nconstraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these\nexperiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar\npipelines."}
