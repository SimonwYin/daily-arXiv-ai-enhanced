This growth comes at the\ncost of increased electricity consumption, which directly correlates to CO2\nemissions, the main driver of climate change. As such, researching ways to\nreduce cloud computing emissions is more relevant than ever. However, although\ncloud providers are reportedly already working near optimal power efficiency,\nthey fail in providing precise sustainability reporting. This calls for further\nimprovements on the cloud computing consumer's side. To this end, in this paper\nwe propose a user-centric, Kubernetes-based architecture for green cloud\ncomputing. We implement a carbon intensity forecaster and we use it to schedule\nworkloads based on the availability of green energy, exploiting both regional\nand temporal variations to minimize emissions. We evaluate our system using\nreal-world traces of cloud workloads execution comparing the achieved carbon\nemission savings against a baseline round-robin scheduler. Our findings\nindicate that our system can achieve up to a 13% reduction in emissions in a\nstrict scenario with heavy limitations on the available resources."}

We further show how this coverage can be enhanced by\nexploiting additional public information. With improved coverage, then\ninterpolation is used to produce the first carbon footprint estimates of the\nTop 500 HPC systems.

Nevertheless,\nquantization may degrade model accuracy and increase susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. Fine-tuning offers a potential means to mitigate these\nlimitations, but its effectiveness when combined with quantization remains\ninsufficiently explored. Hence, it is essential to understand the trade-offs\namong accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. We propose AQUA-LLM, an evaluation\nframework designed to benchmark several state-of-the-art small LLMs under four\ndistinct configurations: base, quantized-only, fine-tuned, and fine-tuned\ncombined with quantization, specifically for cybersecurity QA. Our results\ndemonstrate that quantization alone yields the lowest accuracy and robustness\ndespite improving efficiency. In contrast, combining quantization with\nfine-tuning enhances both LLM robustness and predictive performance, achieving\nan optimal balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. These findings\nhighlight the critical need for quantization-aware, robustness-preserving\nfine-tuning methodologies to enable the robust and efficient deployment of LLMs\nfor cybersecurity QA."}

Their success demonstrates that large-scale\npretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize\nfrom temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to\nleverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for\naccurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific\nnature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a\nlightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate\ninformation without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on\nthe limited history provided during a single model call, learning a\nnon-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.\nHowever, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the\nhistory, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full\nhistorical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage\nmethod: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2)\ntraining a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo-\nand TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation\nmodels and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\\% improvement over base\nfoundation models with minimal data and computational overhead.

Prior approaches focus primarily on\nmeasuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain\nlimited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a\nscalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent\nreasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates\nsynthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in\nmodel-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when\nreasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach\nmodels to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B\nand Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases\nfaithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while\nimproving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first\nscalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more\nreliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between\nreasoning performance and trustworthiness.

This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel\nagent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design\nthrough intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms\nnatural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive,\nhigh-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention.\n$Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent\nserves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates\nexecutable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically\ngenerated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct\nstages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and\neffective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$\nprovides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation\nacross diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive\ntraining management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous\nimprovement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including\nMuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently\noutperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55%\nperformance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly\nend-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in\nwhich intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a\nfundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems."}

Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and\nLlama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific\ncombination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe\nconcept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.\nWe release our code here:\nhttps://github.com/wang-research-lab/SteeringControl.git."}

However, recent work has shown\nthat RAG systems are highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious\ntexts are inserted into the knowledge database to influence model outputs.\nWhile several defenses have been proposed, they are often circumvented by more\nadaptive or sophisticated attacks.\n  This paper presents RAGOrigin, a black-box responsibility attribution\nframework designed to identify which texts in the knowledge database are\nresponsible for misleading or incorrect generations. Our method constructs a\nfocused attribution scope tailored to each misgeneration event and assigns a\nresponsibility score to each candidate text by evaluating its retrieval\nranking, semantic relevance, and influence on the generated response. The\nsystem then isolates poisoned texts using an unsupervised clustering method. We\nevaluate RAGOrigin across seven datasets and fifteen poisoning attacks,\nincluding newly developed adaptive poisoning strategies and multi-attacker\nscenarios.

More recently it\nhas been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major\ntransitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,\nfundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of\ninformation flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether\nchanges in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in\ncognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and\nlaminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars\nthat differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We\ndocumented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent\nnetworks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related\nqualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We\nalso noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of\ntransition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of\nevolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a\nperformance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform\nnon-laminated networks in grammar learning.

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant\nperformance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,\nproviding empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental\nrepresentations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning."}
