### [1] [Read-Modify-Writable Snapshots from Read/Write operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16903)
*Armando Castañeda,Braulio Ramses Hernández Martínez*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 在共享内存系统中，我们提出了两种仅使用读/写操作的RMWable快照算法，扩展了目前的快照实现可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在仅使用基本的读/写操作下，是否可以实现RMWable快照，尤其是在对比&交换或加载-链接/存储-条件等强大低级操作依赖的现有算法的基础上。

Method: 本研究提出了两种RMWable快照算法，一种适用于有限且已知的进程数的标准并发共享内存模型，另一种适用于具有无限多进程但任何时刻参与执行的进程数有限的标准模型变体。

Result: 通过提出两种算法，我们证明了在共享内存系统中，利用基本读/写操作可以实现可读写快照，拓展了快照算法的应用范围。

Conclusion: 我们提出的两种读/写可读写快照算法在不同的并发模型中有效展示了只使用基本读/写操作实现RMWable快照的可能性。

Abstract: In the context of asynchronous concurrent shared-memory systems, a snapshot algorithm allows failure-prone processes to concurrently and atomically write on the entries of a shared array MEM , and also atomically read the whole array. Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Fed-PLoRA是针对异构客户的轻量级联邦学习框架，通过新的PLoRA模块和选择-N-折叠策略，提升了微调效果与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在客户资源异质性下表现欠佳，影响模型性能且存在噪声问题，因此需要开发新方法。

Method: 提出Fed-PLoRA，通过并行单秩适应和选择-N-折叠策略来应对客户资源异质性带来的初始化和聚合噪声。

Result: Fed-PLoRA是一个轻量级的异构联邦微调框架，解决了不同客户资源异质性带来的挑战。通过引入并行单一秩适应模块和选择-N-折叠策略，Fed-PLoRA有效减少了初始化和聚合噪声，提升了模型性能。 extensive experiments表明Fed-PLoRA在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Fed-PLoRA通过创新的PLoRA模块和折叠策略，显著改善了异构客户的微调效果，具备较强的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in adapting to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. However, practical deployments face challenges when clients have heterogeneous resources and thus adopt different LoRA ranks, leading to substantial initialization and aggregation noise that undermines performance. To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [3] [Evaluating Malleable Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters using Real-World Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17318)
*Patrick Zojer,Jonas Posner,Taylan Özden*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 动态调整资源分配的可塑性作业调度在高性能计算中显著提高了资源利用率和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的作业调度方法导致资源浪费和较长的作业等待时间，亟需优化资源利用。

Method: 利用Cori、Eagle和Theta超级计算机的真实工作负载数据，通过ElastiSim软件模拟不同比例的可塑性作业，并评估五种调度策略。

Result: 与完全刚性工作负载相比，可塑性作业在降低作业周转时间、作业历时、作业等待时间和提高节点利用率上均取得显著改善，且改进在可塑性作业比例为20%时仍然显著。

Conclusion: 可塑性作业调度在高性能计算中能有效解决现有效率问题，有限的采用也能带来显著优势，鼓励其纳入资源管理。

Abstract: Optimizing resource utilization in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters is essential for maximizing both system efficiency and user satisfaction. However, traditional rigid job scheduling often results in underutilized resources and increased job waiting times.
  This work evaluates the benefits of resource elasticity, where the job scheduler dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of malleable jobs at runtime. Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.
  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.
  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies. These findings confirm the potential of malleability to address inefficiencies in current HPC practices and demonstrate that even limited adoption can provide substantial advantages, encouraging its integration into HPC resource management.

### [4] [Informative Trains: A Memory-Efficient Journey to a Self-Stabilizing Leader Election Algorithm in Anonymous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17541)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the self-stabilizing leader election problem in anonymous $n$-nodes networks. Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $Ω(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $Ω(\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs.
  In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = Θ(\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged).

### [5] [TopoSZp: Lightweight Topology-Aware Error-controlled Compression for Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17552)
*Tripti Agarwal,Sheng Di,Xin Liang,Zhaoyuan Su,Yuxiao Li,Ganesh Gopalakrishnan,Hanqi Guo,Franck Cappello*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TopoSZp是一种高效的拓扑感知有损压缩器，显著提高了关键点的保存率和压缩/解压性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大规模高性能计算模拟产生的海量数据，现有压缩方案未能有效保存重要拓扑结构。

Method: 结合了高通量SZp压缩器，引入了高效的关键点检测、局部顺序保持和针对鞍点的细化。

Result: TopoSZp在非保存关键点数量上减少了3到100倍，没有引入假阳性或错误的关键点类型，并且在压缩速度和解压速度上显著快于现有方案。

Conclusion: TopoSZp是一个轻量级的拓扑感知、误差控制的有损压缩器，显著提升了科学数据的处理效率和关键点的保存率。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is essential for managing the massive data volumes produced by large-scale HPC simulations. While state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ and ZFP provide strong numerical error guarantees, they often fail to preserve topological structures (example, minima, maxima, and saddle points) that are critical for scientific analysis. Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios.

### [6] [Exploring Novel Data Storage Approaches for Large-Scale Numerical Weather Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17610)
*Nicolau Manubens Gil*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本研究评估了DAOS和Ceph对象存储在HPC与AI应用中的表现，结果表明DAOS在可扩展性和灵活性方面优于传统POSIX文件系统，前景乐观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对HPC与AI应用程序日益增长的数据处理与存储需求，探讨新的存储解决方案以克服POSIX文件系统在特定I/O工作负载下的性能限制。

Method: 评估DAOS和Ceph两种对象存储系统在ECMWF的数值天气预报中的适用性和性能，并开发了新软件适配器进行I/O基准测试。

Result: DAOS相较于Ceph和Lustre提供了卓越的I/O性能，显示出其在大规模应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: DAOS展现出优越于Ceph和Lustre的可扩展性和灵活性，表明在未来HPC中心可能会更广泛采用对象存储，尽管不会完全取代POSIX I/O。

Abstract: Driven by scientific and industry ambition, HPC and AI applications such as operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) require processing and storing ever-increasing data volumes as fast as possible. Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads.
  This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.
  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O.

### [7] [Efficient Remote Prefix Fetching with GPU-native Media ASICs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09725)
*Liang Mi,Weijun Wang,Jinghan Chen,Ting Cao,Haipeng Dai,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: KVFetcher通过优化KV缓存编码和高效传输，显著提高了LLM推理效率，尤其是在带宽受限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM推理的效率并解决带宽受限场景中的KV缓存性能下降问题。

Method: 使用编解码友好的张量布局和高效的KV提取器来压缩和传输KV缓存。

Result: 提出了一种利用GPU原生视频编解码器的高效远程KV缓存重用解决方案KVFetcher。

Conclusion: KVFetcher在保持无损准确率的同时，减少了首次标记生成时间，较现有方法提升了性能。

Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.

### [8] [Robust and Extensible Measurement of Broadband Plans with BQT+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16969)
*Laasya Koduru,Sylee Beltiukov,Alexander Nguyen,Eugene Vuong,Jaber Daneshamooz,Tejas Narechania,Elizabeth Belding,Arpit Gupta*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper presents BQT+, a framework for measuring broadband plans that meets essential needs like robustness, extensibility, and usability for non-experts, enabling effective evaluation of broadband investments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for independent, street address-level broadband data is critical for assessing infrastructure investments and requires a system that can handle varying provider data and changes in interface without high technical expertise.

Method: BQT+ utilizes declarative state/action specifications and models querying intentions as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) to dynamically adapt to changes and streamline data collection from ISPs.

Result: BQT+ enables longitudinal monitoring of broadband plans from 64 ISPs and supports expanded queries for over 100 ISPs, facilitating analyses for policy decisions and evaluating broadband affordability across numerous addresses.

Conclusion: BQT+ successfully addresses the challenges of broadband plan measurement by providing a robust, extensible framework that simplifies longitudinal monitoring across numerous ISPs, facilitating critical policy evaluations.

Abstract: Independent, street address-level broadband data is essential for evaluating Internet infrastructure investments, such as the $42B Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. Evaluating these investments requires longitudinal visibility into broadband availability, quality, and affordability, including data on pre-disbursement baselines and changes in providers' advertised plans. While such data can be obtained through Internet Service Provider (ISP) web interfaces, these workloads impose three fundamental system requirements: robustness to frequent interface evolution, extensibility across hundreds of providers, and low technical overhead for non-expert users. Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements.
  We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications. BQT+ models querying intent as an interaction state space, formalized as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and selects execution paths at runtime to accommodate alternative interaction flows and localized interface changes. We show that BQT+ sustains longitudinal monitoring of 64 ISPs, supporting querying for over 100 ISPs. We apply it to two policy studies: constructing a BEAD pre-disbursement baseline and benchmarking broadband affordability across over 124,000 addresses in four states.

### [10] [MMCAformer: Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer for Traffic Speed Prediction with Microscopic Connected Vehicle Driving Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16730)
*Lei Han,Mohamed Abdel-Aty,Younggun Kim,Yang-Jun Joo,Zubayer Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出MMCAformer，通过结合宏观交通特征和微观驾驶行为特征，提升了速度预测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将微观驾驶行为特征融入速度预测，以实现更主动的交通管理，提高交通效率和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种宏-微交叉注意力变换器（MMCAformer），将基于CV数据的微观驾驶行为特征与宏观交通特征结合，以进行速度预测。

Result: MMCAformer使用自注意力机制学习宏观交通流的内在依赖关系，并利用交叉注意力机制捕捉宏观交通状态与微观驾驶行为之间的时空相互作用，通过学生t负对数似然损失优化，提供逐点速度预测并估计不确定性。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，MMCAformer在预测准确性和不确定性方面显著优于基线模型，尤其在拥堵的低速交通条件下表现更佳。

Abstract: Accurate speed prediction is crucial for proactive traffic management to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.

*Saud Alghumayjan,Ming Yi,Bolun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种利用大型语言模型通过少样本学习预测电力价格波动的方法，该方法在数据稀缺情境下表现出色，与传统监督学习模型相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机在于利用大型语言模型来预测电价在实时情况下的波动，特别是在可以使用的历史数据有限时。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本分类框架，该框架将系统状态信息（例如电力需求、可再生能源生成、天气预报和近期电价）聚合为一组统计特征，并将这些特征格式化为自然语言提示，提供给LLM及一般指令。

Result: 通过对德克萨斯电力市场的历史数据进行分析，该少样本方法的性能与支持向量机和XGBoost等监督学习模型相当，并在历史数据稀缺的情况下优于这两种模型。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了大型语言模型在有限数据情况下进行电价波动分类的有效性，尤其在电力市场数据稀缺时表现优于传统监督学习模型。

Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种不依赖事后特征的混合次级碰撞可能性预测框架，利用实时流量和环境特征，显示出高达91%的准确率和较低的假警报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法依赖于事后碰撞特征，实时性差，限制了其在实际中的应用，因此需要一种不依赖于这些特征的新框架。

Method: 构建了一个混合次级碰撞可能性预测框架，设计了动态时空窗口，提取实时交通流和环境特征，采用六种机器学习算法的集成学习策略并通过投票机制整合三个模型的输出。

Result: 在佛罗里达高速公路上的实验中，混合框架有效识别出91%的次级碰撞，ROC曲线下的面积从个别模型的0.654, 0.744, 和0.902提升至0.952，显示出优越的预测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的混合次级碰撞可能性预测框架在识别次级碰撞方面表现出色，准确率高达91%，假警报率低至0.20，显著优于以往研究。

Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.

Method: 系统研究不同规模的复杂变换器语言模型在不同初始化训练中的稳定性，逐层量化注意力头表示的学习相似性。

Result: 研究表明，注意力头的学习表示在中层最不稳定但最具表现力，深层模型显示出更强的中深度发散，不稳定的头在功能上变得比同层的其他头更为重要，权重衰减优化显著改善了注意力头的稳定性。

Conclusion: 本研究的发现确立了电路跨实例的稳健性，这对于可扩展的监督至关重要，并勾画了AI系统可能的透明监控轮廓。

Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.

Motivation: 当前的数据集大多来自于小规模手动构建或现有资源的重新组合，导致数据多样性和覆盖范围受到限制，从而限制模型性能的提升。

Method: 引入DeepVision-103K数据集，涵盖多样化的K12数学主题、广泛的知识点和丰富的视觉元素，以训练RLVR模型。

Conclusion: DeepVision-103K显著提升了多模态模型的视觉感知、反思和推理能力，验证了其在多模态推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been shown effective in enhancing the visual reflection and reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing datasets are predominantly derived from either small-scale manual construction or recombination of prior resources, which limits data diversity and coverage, thereby constraining further gains in model performance. To this end, we introduce \textbf{DeepVision-103K}, a comprehensive dataset for RLVR training that covers diverse K12 mathematical topics, extensive knowledge points, and rich visual elements. Models trained on DeepVision achieve strong performance on multimodal mathematical benchmarks, and generalize effectively to general multimodal reasoning tasks. Further analysis reveals enhanced visual perception, reflection and reasoning capabilities in trained models, validating DeepVision's effectiveness for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: PETS demonstrates superior sample efficiency and self-consistency in test-time allocation compared to uniform methods, with significant budget reductions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了'Grokking'现象，发现训练过程在低维空间中演变，曲率增长与泛化之间存在提前关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究'Grokking'现象及其与学习和泛化能力的关系，尤其在使用变换器模型进行模块算术训练时。

Method: 通过主成分分析（PCA）研究注意力权重的轨迹，并测量梯度步的非交换性，以探讨损失景观的几何特性。基于因果干预实验验证了学习子空间上运动的重要性。

Result: 通过几何分析优化动态，发现变换器在模块算术训练过程中的训练主要存在于低维执行子空间内。

Conclusion: 曲率的快速增长出现在与执行子空间正交的方向，提前于模型的泛化过程，这意味着'Grokking'现象与从处于低维约束的亚稳态逃逸相关。

Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.

Method: 本研究的方法涉及建立一个实时更新的基准，使用来自当代同行评审的案例报告，并通过239名医生验证的人机工作流程，将真实病例转化为复杂评估场景，用于模拟真实的临床路径。

Result: 本研究提出了LiveClin，这是一个实时基准，旨在评估医疗领域的LLM（大语言模型），提高其在临床实践中的可靠性。LiveClin通过使用来自现代同行评审案例报告的数据，并每六个月更新，以确保临床内容的实时性并抵御数据污染。同时，采用239名医生的验证的AI-人类工作流程，将真实患者案例转化为复杂的多模态评估场景。整个基准目前包含1407个案例报告和6605个问题。对26个模型在LiveClin上的评估表明，现实场景的难度很大，甚至表现最好的模型的病例准确率也仅为35.7%。与人类专家的基准相比，首席医生的准确率最高，其次是住院医生，两者都超过了大多数模型。

Conclusion: LiveClin为医疗LLMs的开发提供了一个持续演进、以临床为基础的框架，旨在缩小其可靠性和实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility.

Conclusion: 通过关注路由器的贡献，显著提升了基于Wi-Fi信号的定位性能。

Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据场景下，传统的中心化数据训练方法存在隐私和效率问题，因此需要一种可扩展且保护隐私的学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种改进的U形分布式联邦学习方法（KD-UFSL），结合微聚合和差分隐私技术，减少通过中间数据传播的隐私泄露。

Result: 通过实验表明，KD-UFSL在某些情况下提高了重构图像的均方误差高达50%，并减少了重构图像的结构相似度高达40%。

Conclusion: KD-UFSL有效提高了隐私保护，同时保留了模型的实用性，适合大规模大数据应用中需要平衡隐私和效用的场景。

Abstract: Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.

TL;DR: OSI-FL is a novel federated learning framework that reduces communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting while learning from incremental data, showing superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of communication and catastrophic forgetting in federated learning under incremental data conditions, ensuring effective learning with limited communication.

Method: The OSI-FL framework utilizes category-specific embeddings from clients using a frozen vision-language model and synthesizes new data with a diffusion model at the server. It incorporates Selective Sample Retention to retain informative samples.

Result: The proposed OSI-FL outperforms previous FL methodologies in both class-incremental and domain-incremental tasks across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: OSI-FL effectively mitigates communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting, demonstrating superior performance in incremental learning scenarios compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现代语言模型在许多任务中表现优异，然而在分布转移情形下，其性能变得不稳定，亟需解决这一问题。

Method: 将语言模型中的分布转移分为可观察和不可观察的成分，并提出一个框架，用于将省略变量的强度映射到最坏情况的泛化性能界限。

Result: 在实证实验中，直接使用这些界限进行语言模型评估和优化，提供了更有原则的离线性能衡量，且相较于传统调整方法，改善了真实的离线性能。

Conclusion: 引入的框架不仅增强了模型在分布转移下的表现，同时还能推断省略变量的强度，尤其在目标分布标签可用时更为有效。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, modern language models remain susceptible to distribution shifts, exhibiting brittle behavior when evaluated on data that differs in distribution from their training data. In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.

Result: DCC 测试并指导 LLMs 的因果推理能力，无需标记的反事实数据。

Conclusion: DCC 在评估多种 LLMs 的因果推理能力方面有效，并可提升多模型家族在推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning benchmarks, large language models (LLMs) have proven brittle when presented with counterfactual questions, suggesting weaknesses in their causal reasoning ability. While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the past year, custom and unreleased math reasoning models reached gold medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: TFFT optimizes tail behavior in fine-tuning diffusion and flow models using CVaR, improving reliability and discovery in applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods maximizing expected rewards fail to control for tail behavior, which is crucial for balancing reliability and novel discovery in practical applications.

Method: TFFT employs a two-stage procedure combining threshold optimization and entropy-regularized fine-tuning using a pseudo-reward, based on a variational dual formulation of CVaR.

Result: TFFT shows significant improvements in generating high-dimensional outputs and in fields like molecular design, by effectively shaping the tail behavior of distributions.

Conclusion: Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT) efficiently optimizes both high-reward and low-reward outcomes using CVaR, demonstrating effectiveness in various applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.

TL;DR: TopoFlow is a physics-guided neural network for air quality prediction that incorporates topography and wind effects, achieving substantial improvements over existing forecasting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of traditional forecasting methods in accurately predicting air quality by embedding physical dynamics into the prediction model.

Method: TopoFlow utilizes a vision transformer architecture that includes topography-aware attention and wind-guided patch reordering to model pollutant dynamics.

Result: The model achieved a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, outperforming traditional systems by 71-80% and demonstrating effectiveness across four major pollutants.

Conclusion: TopoFlow significantly improves air quality prediction through the integration of topography and wind dynamics using a physics-guided neural network.

Abstract: We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.

Method: 提出了一个名为'语言化动作屏蔽'（VAM）的新方法，该方法在提示中语言化了动作屏蔽，确保模型从屏蔽集合中输出动作，并引入迭代动作空间剪枝的概念。

Result: 在棋类游戏中进行研究，分别在引擎对局和固定数据集训练两种模式下进行评估，证明VAM在平均千子损失（ACPL）上提高了学习效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: VAM作为一种可控探索的实际机制，为大型语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.

Method: 通过残差感知的累积注意力展开理论，分析了在有限深度下因果Transformer的注意力分布。

Result: 我们的研究证明了在有限深度下因果Transformer会产生U型位置偏见，注意力集中在早期和晚期的token上。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了对位置偏见现象的结构性解释，揭示了残差连接在防止注意力崩溃中的关键作用，并系统性地分析了Transformer模型的注意力分布特征。

Abstract: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.

Conclusion: 研究结果为PII泄露提供了新视角，揭示了模型表征中潜在信号的叠加特性，使得既能放大风险也能减轻风险。

Abstract: Modern language models exhibit rich internal structure, yet little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors, such as personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, are represented and modulated within their hidden states. We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型面临因RL训练导致的效率瓶颈，尤其是在长时间的回报回滚过程中内存和时间的消耗过大。

Method: 通过逐步编码中间推理为固定大小的向量表示，避免了对完整缓存回滚的反向传播，从而减少了内存使用并在推理时保持恒定内存。

Result: Progressive Thought Encoding显著提高了大推理模型在固定大小缓存下的推理效率和准确性，减少了内存使用，并保持了推理过程中的常量内存。

Conclusion: 通过引入Progressive Thought Encoding，LRMs在内存限制条件下能够有效地进行推理，并且提升了在数学基准上的准确率和RL训练效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

Abstract: We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.

Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.

Motivation: 现代数据集中常包含冗余信息（球状物），增加维度、存储需求和计算成本。

Method: 通过应用熵、互信息、Lasso、SHAP、PCA、主题建模和嵌入分析等技术，识别和删除低效特征。

Result: 实验结果显示，可以以最小的性能损失或甚至改进的分类性能，修剪超过70%的特征空间，并显著减少训练时间和内存占用。

Conclusion: 该框架提供实用指导，帮助减少冗余特征以提高机器学习效率。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil

Conclusion: SymGraph在性能上超过了现有的自解释GNN，且在训练时间上具有显著的加速效果，同时提供了更细粒度的语义规则生成，展示了其在科学发现和可解释AI领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit problem over a continuous, Lipschitz-structured action space where hard collisions yield zero reward. Our objective is to design a communication-free policy that maximizes collective reward, with coordination costs that are independent of the time horizon $T$. We propose a modular protocol that first solves the multi-agent coordination problem -- identifying and seating players on distinct high-value regions via a novel maxima-directed search -- and then decouples the problem into $N$ independent single-player Lipschitz bandits. We establish a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus a $T$-independent coordination cost, matching the single-player rate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework providing such guarantees, and it extends to general distance-threshold collision models.

Conclusion: 通过该理论，分析了一个可证明的、具有局部化块坐标政策改进框架，其保证直接与谱半径相关联。

Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究grokking现象，即在长时间训练后从记忆转向泛化的突变，以及该机制是否超出了算术领域。

Method: 分析两个序列学习基准：SCAN组合泛化和Dyck-1深度预测。探索在多种学习率下，使用由非交换梯度更新推导出的曲率度量（commutator defect）的变化情况。

Result: 在两个任务中，commutator defect的增加出现在泛化之前，且其提前时间遵循超线性幂律；权重空间PCA显示谱集中度不是普遍的前兆，而commutator defect是。

Conclusion: 通过因果干预，验证了commutator defect的机制作用，揭示了其作为延迟泛化的早期预警信号的必要性，并在不同任务中观察到压制或延迟grokking的现象。

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高从目标模型无损采样的效率，尤其是在面对复杂模型时。

Method: 通过系统评估不同的验证策略，同时提出延迟树扩展和动态选择器来优化无损采样过程。

Result: 本研究提出了一种多路径推测解码技术，通过使用低开销的草稿模型生成令牌的草稿树，进而应用验证算法以接受其中的子集，从而加速从目标模型的无损采样。对比现有的各种验证算法，特别是在相匹配的设置下，其相对性能并不明确。我们系统性评估了各种验证策略在不同模型家族、任务和采样过程中，并发现遍历验证（Traversal Verification）始终处于领先地位，而基于最优传输（OT）的方法表现逊色。我们的分析指出，这一现象来源于OT方法在草稿树根部附近能实现高多令牌接受，但在草稿树较深处多令牌增益影响更大，此时草稿分布与目标分布出现偏离。基于这一洞察，我们提出了延迟树扩展（delayed tree expansion）策略，该策略在抓草稿路径时延迟独立同分布分支点。在提升根节点独立同分布采样效果的同时，保持了目标分布的准确性。此外，我们开发了一种动态神经选择器，能够根据草稿和目标特征估计最优传输基验证方法的预期区块效率，从而实现上下文相关的扩展决策。这使得OT方法如SpecInfer首次超越了遍历验证，实现了在多种模型、数据集和采样设置下平均吞吐量提高5%。

Conclusion: 通过延迟树扩展和动态神经选择器的结合，OT方法显著提升了复杂模型采样的效率，相比之前的方法表现更为优秀。

Abstract: Multi-path speculative decoding accelerates lossless sampling from a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a draft tree of tokens, and then applies a verification algorithm that accepts a subset of these. While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.

Result: 提出的方法在VAEs（CIFAR-10）上实现了9%的方差减少，在强耦合的合成问题上最高可减少35%的方差，探索性的策略梯度实验揭示了非平稳优化景观对混合方法的挑战。

Conclusion: Malliavin微积分作为一个概念上统一且在实践中可解释的框架，阐明了混合方法何时提供实际好处及其固有局限性。

Abstract: We establish a rigorous connection between pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators by showing that both arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity. Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in reasoning and the difficulties in calibrating length penalties in GRPO, providing better control over reasoning behavior.

Method: WS-GRPO uses terminal rewards to create correctness-aware guidance for partial trajectories, training a preference model that signals when to continue or stop reasoning.

Result: Empirical results indicate that WS-GRPO reduces rollout length substantially compared to GRPO, achieving competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: WS-GRPO significantly improves rollout efficiency while maintaining accuracy, outperforming GRPO baselines on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.

Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.

TL;DR: FATE is an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that improves early warning capabilities in time-series data by using ensemble forecasting models and achieves significant performance gains without needing anomaly labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for proactive anomaly detection in time-series data across various domains, as traditional methods only react to anomalies post-occurrence.

Method: FATE uses an unsupervised framework that quantifies predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of forecasting models to detect Precursors-of-Anomaly.

Result: FATE improves the PTaPR AUC by 19.9 percentage points and the early detection F1 score by 20.02 percentage points compared to baseline methods, validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: FATE demonstrates superior performance in detecting anomalies proactively in time-series data, significantly improving early warning capabilities with no need for anomaly labels.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.

TL;DR: MPZCH is a new indexing method that eliminates embedding collisions in recommendation systems, enhancing model performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and performance degradation of traditional hash-based indexing methods in large-scale recommendation systems due to high-cardinality categorical feature collisions.

Method: Utilizes a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing, employing auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels for configurable probing and eviction policies.

Result: MPZCH effectively eliminates embedding collisions with reasonable table sizing, maintaining production-scale efficiency and improving embedding freshness and quality. It also retains competitive training QPS and inference latency relative to existing methods.

Conclusion: MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and enhances the quality of item embeddings, supporting efficient recommendation systems.

Abstract: Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community.

Conclusion: 通过优化初始化和引入轻量级的外漂移正则化，显著降低了有效符号翻转率，同时对模型的困惑度影响较小。

Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.

Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.

Motivation: 现有优化算法如Adam和Muon在处理随机扰动时的表现有限，因此需要设计新的优化器以提高大型语言模型训练的效率和效果。

Method: 提出了NAMO和NAMO-D优化器，结合了正交动量和基于范数的噪声适应，NAMO通过单一自适应步长扩展正交动量，而NAMO-D通过对角矩阵右乘正交动量实现了神经元级的噪声适应。

Result: 在满足标准假设的情况下，建立了两种算法在确定性设置下的最优收敛速率，并显示在随机设置下，它们的收敛保证适应随机梯度的噪声水平。实验结果显示NAMO和NAMO-D相较于AdamW和Muon基线具有更卓越的性能。

Conclusion: NAMO和NAMO-D优化器在预训练GPT-2模型中表现优于AdamW和Muon，特别是NAMO-D通过附加的调节超参数在更新方向和噪声适应之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.

Motivation: 随着对训练数据隐私的日益关注，"被遗忘权利"成为一项重要要求，从而提升了对有效机器遗忘的需求。

Method: 通过分析在模型预训练中学习到的内在表示属性，提出了机器引导遗忘（MeGU）框架，通过概念感知的重新对齐来指导遗忘过程，使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）来确定目标样本的重新对齐方向，并引入正负特征噪声对以明确区分目标概念影响。

Conclusion: 通过协调设计，MeGU使遗忘过程可控和选择性，能够在保留相关特征的同时，抑制目标特定特征模式。

Abstract: The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the "Right to be Forgotten" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.

Conclusion: FLoRG有效解决了通过低秩适应进行联邦微调中的聚合误差和分解漂移问题，保证了更新的一致性和收敛性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.

Abstract: This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics.

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少了时间步敏感性，确保物理一致性，适用于复杂动态转变的物理模拟。

Abstract: Physical simulation predicts future states of objects based on material properties and external loads, enabling blueprints for both Industry and Engineering to conduct risk management. Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions.

Conclusion: TIFO显著提高了时间序列预测的准确性和效率，尤其在处理分布变化问题时表现出色。

Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.

Conclusion: VP-VAE和FSP在生成建模方面展示了比传统VQ-VAEs更高的重建保真度和更均衡的标记使用，同时避免了训练中代码本耦合的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.

Result: PiCCE proves statistically consistent and recovers class probabilities and expert accuracies, validated through extensive experiments in varied settings.

Conclusion: PiCCE successfully reduces multi-expert L2D challenges to a single-expert problem, improving performance by effectively selecting reliable experts.

Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the divide in time series modeling between numerical generation and semantic understanding, leveraging the potential of unified multimodal models.

Method: The framework introduces bidirectional mapping for time series and images, along with a novel dataset for understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the link between understanding and generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both semantic understanding and numerical output, paving the way for advanced multimodal time series modeling.

Conclusion: TimeOmni-VL unifies time series understanding and generation, improving semantic understanding and numerical precision through innovative bidirectional mapping and guided generation.

Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a gradient-free alternative to first-order (FO) methods by estimating gradients via finite differences of function evaluations, and has recently emerged as a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale models by avoiding backpropagation. However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SoftDTW GPU实现的关键限制，如序列长度上限、数值不稳定性和内存消耗。

Method: 引入平铺反对角线内核执行、对数空间反向传播以及融合距离计算模式。

Result: 使得支持任意序列长度，集成全PyTorch自动求导，并实现Soft-DTW Barycenter计算。

Conclusion: 相较于之前的工作，内存消耗减少高达98%。

Abstract: We present softdtw-cuda-torch, an open-source PyTorch library for computing Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) on GPUs. Our implementation addresses three key limitations of existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW: a hard sequence-length cap of 1024, numerical instability in the backward pass for small smoothing parameters, and excessive GPU memory consumption from materializing pairwise distance tensors. We introduce (1) tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution that removes the sequence-length constraint, (2) a log-space back-ward pass that prevents floating-point overflow, and (3) a fused distance-computation mode that eliminates the O(BN M ) intermediate distance tensor, achieving up to 98% memory reduction compared to prior work. The library supports arbitrary sequence lengths, full PyTorch autograd integration, and Soft-DTW Barycenter computation. Code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/sdtw-cuda-torch.

Conclusion: 与标签有限的跨受试者设置下，SCOPE在三个EEG任务和五个基础模型骨干上持续展现出强劲的表现和效率。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.

Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.

Conclusion: 提出了一个名为RLGT的新框架，支持多种图结构，并旨在优化计算性能，以促进极端图论的RL研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.

Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.

TL;DR: LexiSafe is an offline safe RL framework designed to maintain safety and enhance performance, offering theoretical guarantees and empirical advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind LexiSafe is to address the lack of structural mechanisms in existing offline safe RL methods that prevent safety drift.

Method: The paper introduces LexiSafe, an offline reinforcement learning framework that includes LexiSafe-SC for standard scenarios and LexiSafe-MC for hierarchical safety requirements.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that LexiSafe significantly lowers safety violations while improving task performance compared to existing constrained offline methods.

Conclusion: LexiSafe provides a robust framework for offline safe reinforcement learning, ensuring reduced safety violations and enhanced performance in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.

Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the accuracy gap between linear attention methods like Mamba-2 and traditional softmax attention.

Method: We simplify Mamba-2 to its core components and enhance its A-mask while increasing the hidden state order to create 2Mamba.

Result: 2Mamba shows improved accuracy and memory efficiency compared to both Mamba-2 and softmax attention for long context lengths.

Conclusion: 2Mamba achieves almost the same accuracy as softmax attention while being more memory efficient for long contexts.

Abstract: Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the adoption of machine learning in biomedical data by addressing issues of robustness, interpretability, and feature stability under data perturbations.

Method: CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and stability analysis, benchmarking its performance against traditional machine learning methods on a clinical dataset.

Result: CACTUS demonstrates competitive predictive performance with higher stability of informative features as data completeness changes, highlighting the importance of feature stability in assessing model reliability.

Conclusion: CACTUS offers a robust and interpretable framework for machine learning in biomedical datasets, emphasizing feature stability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.

Conclusion: 该方法在与完全数据驱动的方法和之前的灰盒基线相比，展示出等同或优越的性能，同时保持物理模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

Motivation: 探究反馈延迟对多智能体学习的影响及对应的收敛率，尤其是在双线性博弈中。

Method: 提出WOGDA算法，并将其视作额外近端点（EPP）的近似，基于比传统近端点（PP）更远的未来奖励进行更新。

Result: 标准乐观预测的下一步奖励在$t$次迭代后，以速率$	ext{exp}(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$线性收敛至均衡，而增加乐观预测的额外未来奖励使收敛速率加快至$	ext{exp}(-Θ(t/(m^{2}	ext{log} m)))$，允许更大的步长。

Conclusion: 额外的乐观预测是一种有效的对策，可以减轻因反馈延迟引起的性能下降。

Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.

TL;DR: CRAFT is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using Tucker decomposition on transformer attention weights, requiring only 41K adaptation parameters and achieving competitive results on the GLUE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to enhance parameter efficiency in model fine-tuning by integrating advancements in Tucker decomposition and gradient update methods while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: CRAFT employs Tucker tensor decomposition on pre-trained attention weights across transformer layers, allowing for efficient adaptation via small square matrices applied to frozen factors.

Result: CRAFT achieves performance comparable to existing tensor-based methods while significantly reducing the number of adaptation parameters to 41K, which is independent of model dimension and depth.

Conclusion: CRAFT demonstrates competitive performance on the GLUE benchmark with significantly fewer adaptation parameters compared to other methods.

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.

Abstract: In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $π$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution. However, in many cases of practical interest, Gaussian distributions might not capture the correct radial profile of $π$, resulting in poor coverage. In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).

Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.

Conclusion: 本研究呼吁改进当前12导联心电图表示学习的基准实践，以实现更可靠的进展并与临床目标对齐。

Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.

Motivation: To address the misalignment of current RLVR algorithms with the complex dynamics of Large Language Models.

Method: Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO) framework

Result: Integrates differentiable soft Gaussian gating, mass-adaptive limiter, and asymmetric risk controller

Conclusion: MASPO outperforms existing RLVR algorithms significantly in addressing gradient utilization, probability mass sensitivity, and signal reliability.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: 研究表明，模型之间的映射关系通过一个正交映射 $Q$ 可实现，从而促进了模型的向后兼容性，并对学习表示的隐私性有启示。

Abstract: As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出VCPO方法，通过方差控制提高了异步RL的训练稳定性，显著降低了训练时间，并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在推理任务中的广泛应用，强化学习（RL）被用于提升其性能，而异步RL训练因提高了端到端的吞吐量而变得有吸引力。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法：方差控制策略优化（VCPO），该方法为REINFORCE/GRPO风格的算法提供了一种通用的稳定化方案，通过根据有效样本大小调整学习率以降低不可靠更新，并在离线策略设定下应用闭式的最小方差基线，避免了辅助值模型，增加了最小的开销。

Result: VCPO在数学、一般推理和工具使用任务中显著提高了异步训练的鲁棒性，优于广泛的基线方法，包括掩码/裁剪稳定器和算法变体。

Conclusion: 通过明确控制策略梯度的方差，VCPO在大规模可靠的异步RL中至关重要，能将长上下文、多轮训练时间减少2.5倍，同时保持同步性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.

Conclusion: 我们开发了一种在线算法，能够在不依赖于查询流、语言模型或弱验证器的假设下，证明地控制接受和拒绝错误。

Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.

Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.

TL;DR: FAMOSE is a novel framework for automated feature engineering using the ReAct paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results in both classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature engineering is a cumbersome process in machine learning for tabular data, often requiring extensive domain expertise to identify optimal features from a vast space.

Method: A novel framework called FAMOSE was developed, utilizing the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features along with integrated feature selection and evaluation tools.

Result: FAMOSE demonstrates near state-of-the-art performance in classification tasks (ROC-AUC improvement by 0.23%) and state-of-the-art performance in regression tasks (RMSE reduction by 2.0%), while showing robustness to errors in comparison to other algorithms.

Conclusion: FAMOSE showcases the effectiveness of AI agents in automated feature engineering, achieving state-of-the-art results in both classification and regression tasks while being more robust to errors.

Abstract: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.

Motivation: 提出针对大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的黑箱对抗攻击方法，克服现有方法的不足，尤其是高方差的梯度问题和优化的不稳定性。

Method: 通过重构局部匹配为源变换和目标语义的非对称期望，提出了一种改进的多粘性对抗攻击（M-Attack-V2），引入多剪裁对齐（MCA）和辅助目标对齐（ATA），以及补丁动量（Patch Momentum）等技术以降低梯度方差并增强可转移性。

Result: M-Attack-V2显著提高了对前沿LVLMs的黑箱攻击成功率：Claude-4.0从8%提升至30%，Gemini-2.5-Pro从83%提升至97%，GPT-5从98%提升至100%。

Conclusion: M-Attack-V2作为对M-Attack的简化模块增强，突破了对黑箱LVLMs攻击的性能瓶颈，成为一种更具有效性的攻击方法。

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中，人工智能与人类的合作需保证增强人类决策能力而非削弱，确保能在易出错环节提供额外价值。

Method: 引入在线分布自由算法，施加用户定义的反事实伤害与互补性约束，应用于医学诊断与图像推理任务中的协作评估。

Result: 该在线程序在非平稳互动动态下保持预设的反事实伤害和互补性违规率，调整约束可以预测人类准确性变化。

Conclusion: 验证了反事实伤害和互补性原则作为多轮协作中提高决策质量的有效工具，无需建模或限制人类行为。

Abstract: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MARS的自适应数据增强策略，旨在提高奖励模型的可靠性，针对数据样本中的模糊和失败模式进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模是现代对齐管道的核心，然而，训练可靠的奖励模型依赖于人类标记的偏好数据，这些数据成本高且有限，因此需要数据增强。

Method: 提出MARS，一个自适应、边距感知的增强和采样策略，专注于奖励模型的不确定性，特别是在低边际偏好对上进行增强。

Result: 通过理论保证，证明该策略增加了损失函数的平均曲率，增强了信息量并改善了条件，同时实证结果显示MARS在稳健奖励建模上相较于均匀增强取得了持续的提升。

Conclusion: MARS策略能够有效提升奖励模型的可靠性，尤其是在处理模糊和困难的偏好数据时。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.

*Shahriar Golchin,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究评估了AI安全数据集在反映现实世界攻击中的有效性，发现过度依赖触发线索导致评估失真，并提出意图洗白技术揭示了模型安全评估与实际行为之间的脱节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估广泛使用的AI安全数据集在真实世界攻击中的有效性，以改善安全机制的设计和数据集的构建。

Method: 通过引入意图洗白程序，抽象掉攻击数据中的触发线索，同时严格保留其恶意意图和相关细节，对AI安全数据集进行系统性评估。

Result: 当移除触发线索后，所有之前评估为"合理安全"的模型均变得不安全，意图洗白技术适应为越狱技术后，成功率达到90%以上。

Conclusion: 当前的AI安全数据集由于过度依赖触发线索而未能真实反映现实世界的攻击，评估模型安全的方式与现实世界对手的行为之间存在显著脱节。

Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.

TL;DR: 研究发现对抗性注释对大型语言模型（LLM）在漏洞检测中的影响不明显，且多种防御措施中静态分析表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对抗性注释在漏洞检测中的有效性和对LLM性能的影响，以评估其在代码安全中的风险。

Method: 构建由100个样本及其附带的八种注释变体的基准测试，评价八个前沿模型在9,366次试验中的表现。

Result: 对抗性注释对检测准确性的影响微小且统计上不显著，静态分析方法达96.9%的检测率，并修复了47%的遗漏。

Conclusion: 在对抗性注释操作下，LLM在漏洞检测中的性能并未显著下降，复杂的对抗性策略并未优于简单的方法。自动防御措施中，静态分析交叉引用最为有效。

Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的应用普及，理解其安全性与脆弱性变得至关重要，特别是在排名决策中。

Method: 通过对两种评估任务进行系统实验，分别测量攻击成功率和排名质量，并分析不同模型和设置下的脆弱性。

Result: 发现编码-解码架构对 Jailbreak 攻击具有更强的抵御能力，为模型选择和安全性提供了重要见解。

Conclusion: 总结了对大型语言模型在排名中的安全脆弱性研究，提出了两种评估方法，并揭示了不同模型架构的抗攻击能力差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful re-rankers. Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks. We publicly release our code and additional experimental results at https://github.com/ielab/LLM-Ranker-Attack.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型在大规模去匿名化中表现出色，突破了传统方法的限制，揭示了在线隐私的新威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of large language models in deanonymization at scale, surpassing previous methods reliant on structured data or manual feature engineering.

Method: Developed a scalable attack pipeline leveraging large language models to extract identity features, match candidates through semantic embeddings, and reason over top candidates to verify matches.

Result: Achieved up to 68% recall at 90% precision in deanonymization tasks, outperforming classical methods and illustrating the vulnerability of online pseudonymous users.

Conclusion: LLM-based attacks demonstrate significant effectiveness in deanonymizing online pseudonymous users, necessitating a reevaluation of online privacy threat models.

Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.

TL;DR: NeST是一个轻量的安全对齐框架，通过适应少量神经元，提高LLMs的安全性，显著减少不安全生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性对其负责任的部署至关重要。但现有方法依赖于成本高昂的全面微调，难以更新、审核和维护。

Method: 提出NeST，一个轻量且结构意识的安全对齐框架，通过选择性调整少量安全相关神经元，同时冻结模型其余部分，从而增强拒绝行为。

Result: 在10个不同的开放权重LLM上比较了NeST与三种主要基线：全面微调、基于LoRA的微调和电路断路器，发现NeST使攻击成功率从平均44.5%降低到4.36%，对应着90.2%的不安全生成减少。

Conclusion: NeST在模型更新参数少且实现强安全性能的前提下，提供了有针对性和稳定的安全适应方案。

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for the responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.
  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新协议，以在保持隐私的同时验证大型语言模型的推理，改善性能和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的增长，用户在本地无法托管和运行模型，导致对第三方托管服务的需求增加，但在这种情况下缺乏可执行计算的保证。

Method: 我们提出了两种新协议，利用私密LLM推理提供推理的保证。

Result: 提出的协议成本低，仅需增加少量计算额外代币，并对下游影响极小，还提高了验证运行时。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了隐私和可验证性在大语言模型推理之间联系的新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fewer users are able to host and run models locally. This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的密码学安全定义依赖于游戏基础或模拟基础，需要一个新的视角来重新表述这些安全性概念。

Method: 通过使用Grothendieck拓扑和层理论，将攻击者观察建模为Grothendieck站点，并分析$Σ$-协议的传输结构。

Result: 证明$Σ$-协议的传输结构定义了与层相关的拓扑空间中的一个torsor，局部平凡性对应于零知识，而缺乏全局截面反映了健全性，并具体分析了Schnorr $Σ$-协议。

Conclusion: 本论文提出的新的结构性重新表述为密码学安全提供了几何基础，并为进一步的密码学抽象打开了新的视角。

Abstract: Cryptographic security is traditionally formulated using game-based or simulation-based definitions. In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.
  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.
  As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.
  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.

Motivation: 探索Fischlin变换在量子对手下的可提取性，解决这一开放性问题，以确保在量子计算环境下的安全性。

Method: 通过基于压缩Oracle的提取器，利用独立随机变量和马尔可夫链的尾界、对称化、询问幅度和量子并集界限的论证。

Result: Fischlin变换在量子可访问随机预言模型中是可直线提取的，证明了该变换在后量子时代的安全性。

Conclusion: 证明Fischlin变换在量子可及随机预言模型中保持直线可提取性，确立了其后量子安全性，并提供了一个较小证明大小的后量子直线可提取NIZK替代方案。

Abstract: The Fischlin transform yields non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs with straight-line extractability in the classical random oracle model. This is done by forcing a prover to generate multiple accepting transcripts through a proof-of-work mechanism. Whether the Fischlin transform is straight-line extractable against quantum adversaries has remained open due to the difficulty of reasoning about the likelihood of query transcripts in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM), even when using the compressed oracle methodology. In this work, we prove that the Fischlin transform remains straight-line extractable in the QROM, via an extractor based on the compressed oracle. This establishes the post-quantum security of the Fischlin transform, providing a post-quantum straight-line extractable NIZK alternative to Pass' transform with smaller proof size. Our techniques include tail bounds for sums of independent random variables and for martingales as well as symmetrization, query amplitude and quantum union bound arguments.

Result: 识别出具身AI系统面临四个关键挑战，表明现有研究对于具身AI安全的认识存在不足之处。

Conclusion: 要保障具身人工智能系统的安全，需要超越组件级的防御，开展关于物理风险、不确定性和故障传播的系统级推理。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, service robots, and LLM-driven interactive agents) are rapidly transitioning from controlled environments to safety critical real-world deployments. Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.

Motivation: 当前的跨组织数据空间在使用政策执行上过于粗糙，无法有效地保护敏感信息，需要一个更加灵活与高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出虚拟红action方法，通过自然语言接口处理文档的部分敏感信息，不需要修改源文档。

Result: 开发了DAVE这一基于自然语言的政策执行者，并建立了与Eclipse Dataspace组件和ODRL政策集成的初步原型。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的使用政策执行框架，旨在改善数据共享中的信息安全性与效率，经过迭代与验证，将为多方数据空间中的LLM接入提供基础。

Abstract: In current inter-organizational data spaces, usage policies are enforced mainly at the asset level: a whole document or dataset is either shared or withheld. When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高机器学习模型推理的隐私性和可验证性，同时解决内存限制问题，Jolt Atlas利用ONNX的开放格式和Jolt证明系统的优势。

Method: 通过查找论证和sumcheck协议，Jolt Atlas直接应用于ONNX张量操作，进行多种优化，包括神经远程传送和张量级验证优化。

Result: Jolt Atlas显著缩短了证明时间，能够高效地验证分类、嵌入、自动推理和小型语言模型，并且能在没有专用硬件的设备上运行。

Conclusion: Jolt Atlas是一个设计用于零知识机器学习的框架，通过优化和适应Jolt的查找中心方法，使得模型推理能够在内存受限的环境中进行，并实现隐私保护和对抗环境的验证。

Abstract: We present Jolt Atlas, a zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework that extends the Jolt proving system to model inference. Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.
  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.
  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \textit{AI memory}).

Conclusion: 通过审计12个开源库，我们发现了13个影响其理论保证的隐私违规行为，并推出了一个易于集成的工具包。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) implementations are notoriously prone to errors, with subtle bugs frequently invalidating theoretical guarantees. Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs. We generalize this to Re:cord-play-sample, a full statistical audit that isolates and tests each component, including untrusted ones. We show that our novel testing approach is both effective and necessary by auditing 12 open-source libraries, including SmartNoise SDK, Opacus, and Diffprivlib, and uncovering 13 privacy violations that impact their theoretical guarantees. We release our framework as an open-source Python package, thereby making it easy for DP developers to integrate effective, computationally inexpensive, and seamless privacy testing as part of their software development lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代币支付系统（如加密货币和CBDC）的兴起，优化交易资金的代币选择变得更为重要。

Method: Boltzmann Draw是一种基于玻尔兹曼分布的概率算法，用于选择代币，扩展和改进了随机抽取方法。

Result: 通过数值结果验证了Boltzmann Draw在限制选择的输入代币数量、减少灰尘生成和限制钱包代币池大小方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Boltzmann Draw is an effective probabilistic algorithm for coin selection in token-based payment systems, improving on previous methods by reducing token pool size and enhancing performance while ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Coin selection refers to the problem of choosing a set of tokens to fund a transaction in token-based payment systems such as, e.g., cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, we propose the Boltzmann Draw that is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the principles of statistical physics. The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives. Our findings are relevant for token-based technologies, and are also of interest for CBDCs, which as a legal tender possibly needs to handle large transaction volumes at a high frequency.

TL;DR: 本研究证明了在NP不在ioP/poly的假设下，非平凡的NIZK证明与单向函数的存在性之间的关系，并扩展到了交互式场景，为构造单向函数提供新的途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机在于填补当前在高错误率下，非平凡NIZK证明与单向函数之间的联系缺口，并探讨其在交互式设置中的应用。

Method: 本文采用了复杂性理论的分析方法，以探讨非平凡NIZK与单向函数之间的关系并使用放大技术进行标准NIZK证明的转换。

Result: 本研究建立了非平凡的非交互式零知识（NIZK）证明对于NP类的存在性与单向函数（OWF）的存在性之间的联系。具体而言，若NP不包含在ioP/poly中，则存在非平凡的常数轮次公开币零知识Argument的非交互式推导，从而推导出OWF的存在。此外，本文还通过已知的放大技术，将弱NIZK证明转变为标准NIZK证明，适用于所有有意义的错误参数。

Conclusion: 通过研究非平凡的NIZK与OWF之间的关系，本文解决了在高错误率情况下，构造单向函数的难题。同时，研究结果进一步推广到了交互式设置中，为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough [Hirahara and Nanashima, STOC'2024] established that if $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$, the existence of zero-knowledge with negligible errors for $\mathsf{NP}$ implies the existence of one-way functions (OWFs). In this work, we obtain a characterization of one-way functions from the worst-case complexity of zero-knowledge {\em in the high-error regime}.
  We say that a zero-knowledge argument is {\em non-trivial} if the sum of its completeness, soundness and zero-knowledge errors is bounded away from $1$. Our results are as follows, assuming $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$:
  1. {\em Non-trivial} Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK) arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs. Using known amplification techniques, this result also provides an unconditional transformation from weak to standard NIZK proofs for all meaningful error parameters.
  2. We also generalize to the interactive setting: {\em Non-trivial} constant-round public-coin zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs, and therefore also (standard) four-message zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$.
  Prior to this work, one-way functions could be obtained from NIZKs that had constant zero-knowledge error $ε_{zk}$ and soundness error $ε_{s}$ satisfying $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} < 1$ [Chakraborty, Hulett and Khurana, CRYPTO'2025]. However, the regime where $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} \geq 1$ remained open. This work closes the gap, and obtains new implications in the interactive setting. Our results and techniques could be useful stepping stones in the quest to construct one-way functions from worst-case hardness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及无证个人和无陪伴未成年人案件中，法医年龄评估对于保护、医疗和司法程序至关重要。

Method: 开发领域特定的AIdentifyAGE本体，提供标准化的框架，涵盖手工和AI辅助的法医学牙齿年龄评估工作流程。

Result: AIdentifyAGE本体通过建模完整的法医学工作流程，实现观察、方法、参考数据和报告结果之间的可追溯链接，确保各系统之间的互操作性。

Conclusion: AIdentifyAGE本体为法医学和司法背景下的决策支持系统奠定了坚实的基础，增强了一致性、透明性和可解释性。

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自然和人工智能系统中单状态重用的基本表征后果及其普遍性。

Method: 将上下文建模为作用于共享内部状态的干预，证明任何经典模型在重现上下文统计结果时必然产生信息理论成本。

Result: 给出最小构造示例，明确并解释该成本的操作意义，同时展示非经典概率框架如何通过放宽全局联合概率空间假设来避免此限制。

Conclusion: 上下文性是自适应智能的普遍表征约束，与物理实现无关。

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

Conclusion: MobCache框架有效提升了人类移动模拟的效率，且在性能上不逊色于当前最先进的LLM方法。

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

Conclusion: 通过构建8个超平面切割十维超立方体，作者证明了新的上界，该方法利用了CPro1工具。

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

TL;DR: Node Learning is a decentralized learning framework that empowers edge nodes to learn independently and collaborate, addressing the shortcomings of centralized intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of centralized AI that struggles with latency, energy efficiency, and scalability in diverse environments.

Method: Introducing a new conceptual framework for decentralized learning that emphasizes individual edge nodes learning from local data and collaborating opportunistically.

Result: Node Learning allows for continuous learning at the edge with improved collaboration and less dependence on centralized systems, enhancing adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Node Learning presents a decentralized learning paradigm optimizing local data utilization and peer interaction while respecting heterogeneity in resources and objectives.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

Motivation: 针对传统对犹豫模糊集的评分方法缺乏秩序理论基础的问题，提出了一种统一的框架以提升评分机制的灵活性和一致性。

Method: 定义与特定秩序相关的评分，并研究几种经典的犹豫模糊元素上的秩序，证明它们不形成格结构，且对称秩序下定义的评分满足重要的评分函数规范条件。

Conclusion: 这些主导函数可用于构建模糊偏好关系，并支持群体决策。

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

TL;DR: OpenSage is a pioneering ADK that allows LLMs to autonomously develop agents, offering enhanced functionality and efficiency in agent management and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved generalizability and performance in agents developed using ADKs, which currently depend heavily on human intervention.

Method: Research involved designing OpenSage tooling, implementing a hierarchical memory system, and conducting experiments on various benchmarks to evaluate performance.

Result: OpenSage outperformed existing ADKs in extensive experiments, showing enhanced functionality in agent creation, management, and memory system efficiency.

Conclusion: OpenSage can revolutionize agent development by enabling AI to autonomously create agents and manage resources effectively, surpassing limitations of current ADKs.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

Motivation: 旨在评估大型语言模型在规划与推理能力方面的表现，推动相关研究的发展。

Method: 通过要求模型在维基百科中导航，评估其在不同难度任务中的表现。

Result: LLM-Wikirace为大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了一种评估规划、推理和世界知识的新基准。模型需通过高效的方式逐步导航维基百科链接，从给定源页到目标页，这要求模型具备前瞻性规划和推理能力。

Conclusion: 尽管在简单任务上表现出色，但模型在较难任务上的表现显著下降，表明现有模型在复杂推理和规划能力上仍有重大挑战。此外，模型在失败后重规划的能力不足，常常陷入循环。

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型作为智能体与外部系统互动，通过工具调用进行的行为越来越普遍，传统评估只关注文本层面的安全，未考虑工具调用的潜在危害。

Method: 引入GAP基准，系统评估文本安全与工具调用安全之间的差异，测试六个前沿模型在六个受监管领域下的表现。

Result: 我们发现，文本安全未能有效转移至工具调用安全，存在文本拒绝请求但工具调用依然执行禁用行为的情况。

Conclusion: 文本安全评估不足以全面评估智能体的行为，需要专门测量和减轻工具调用安全性。

Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.

### [117] [HQFS: Hybrid Quantum Classical Financial Security with VQC Forecasting, QUBO Annealing, and Audit-Ready Post-Quantum Signing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16976)
*Srikumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HQFS is a hybrid financial risk system that merges forecasting, discrete optimization, and auditability, enhancing prediction accuracy and decision-making in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses the instability and inefficiencies in traditional financial risk systems when confronted with real-world constraints, particularly in regulated environments demanding audit trails.

Method: HQFS employs a variational quantum circuit for next-step return and volatility prediction, transforms objectives and constraints into QUBO, and utilizes quantum annealing or classical solvers for optimization, along with post-quantum signatures for verification.

Result: HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8%, volatility error by 6.1%, improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4%, reduces maximum drawdown by 11.7%, and achieves a 28% reduction in average solve time compared to classical methods, while ensuring traceable allocations.

Conclusion: HQFS significantly enhances financial risk systems by integrating forecasting, optimization, and auditability, yielding notable improvements in prediction accuracy and decision-making performance.

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

Conclusion: 本研究量化了黑箱测试在评估AI系统安全性时的局限性，并提出了需要额外保障措施的明确标准。

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Conv-FinRe基准，旨在通过.evaluate LLM在股票推荐中的表现，超越用户行为模仿，揭示决策质量与行为一致性之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融顾问领域，传统推荐基准未能充分考虑用户长远目标与市场波动带来的噪音影响。

Method: 引入Conv-FinRe基准，通过对话和纵向分析评估股票推荐中的LLM表现，超越行为匹配。

Result: Conv-FinRe基准提供多视角参考，区分投资者特定风险偏好的描述行为与规范效用，识别模型是否遵循理性分析、模仿用户噪音或受市场动量驱动。

Conclusion: 在理性决策质量与行为一致性之间存在张力：注重效用排名的模型往往无法匹配用户选择，而行为一致的模型可能会过拟合短期噪音。

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非专业用户提供有效的时间序列数据库（TSDB）查询，特别是处理形状和异常等连续形态意图。

Method: 提出了一种名为Sonar-TS的神经符号框架，通过搜索-验证管道处理自然语言查询。

Result: Sonar-TS能够成功处理复杂的时间查询，克服传统方法的局限；并引入了首个大型基准NLQTSBench，专为TSDB历史查询设计。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性探讨了NLQ4TSDB，提供了一种通用框架和评估标准，以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Cinder，一个通过快速初筛与精准评估相结合的双阶段匹配系统，旨在解决多人在线游戏中的公平匹配问题并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多人在线游戏中，公平且快速的匹配系统对于提高玩家留存率和满意度至关重要，而不同技能水平队伍之间的公平匹配是一个重大挑战。

Method: Cinder系统包括两个阶段：第一阶段利用Ruzicka相似度指数快速过滤非异常技能范围的队伍，第二阶段则使用基于反正态分布生成的非线性技能桶对玩家排名进行映射，从而实现更高的匹配精度。

Result: 该系统的双阶段匹配方法有效提升了公平性，通过分析140百万次模拟的Sanction Score分布，为公平匹配阈值提供了扎实基础。

Conclusion: 该系统通过快速筛选与精确评估相结合，实现了更加公平和迅速的匹配，在140百万次模拟中的成功应用证明了其有效性。

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

*Zichen Wang,Wanli Ma,Zhenyu Ming,Gong Zhang,Kun Yuan,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2F是一个创新的框架，能够实现项目级数学文献的自动形式化，显著提高了自动验证的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学形式化主要局限于孤立定理和短片段，缺乏针对教科书和研究论文的自动化形式化解决方案。

Method: M2F框架分为两个阶段：声明编译阶段将文档划分为原子块并根据依赖性排序，修复声明骨架；证明修复阶段通过局部编辑填补空缺，确保项目编译。

Result: M2F成功将479页关于实分析和凸分析的教材转换为153,853行的Lean库，自动化时间仅为约三周，且在FATE-H测试中实现96%的证明成功率。

Conclusion: 这表明大规模自动形式化数学文献的可行性，M2F大幅提高了形式化过程的效率，并降低了专家的工作量。

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.

Conclusion: 通过这一评估，客户可以更清晰地比较不同的AI系统，以确保选择满足他们需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality.

*Uria Franko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ITR optimizes LLM agent performance by reducing context token usage and improving tool selection efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costs, latency, and errors associated with LLM agents processing long instructions and tool catalogs.

Method: Proposes Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a method that retrieves minimal system prompt fragments and a smaller subset of tools at each step.

Result: ITR achieves a 95% reduction in context tokens, a 32% improvement in tool routing accuracy, and a 70% reduction in episode cost compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ITR greatly enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of LLM agents, particularly for long-running tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型推理模型输出的可信度和可靠性。

Method: 建立了一个用于推理忠实性评估的正式框架，定义了两个可测试的条件，并在此基础上开发了RFEval基准。

Result: 通过对12个开源LRM的评估，发现49.7%的输出存在忠实性问题，且大多数问题源于立场不一致。

Conclusion: 真实的AI信任需要在优化准确性之外，更加注重推理过程的结构完整性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

Motivation: 现有的MARL方法依赖单一最优动作，难以适应训练过程中价值函数的变化，且易收敛于次优策略。

Method: 提出了Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q)，学习多个子值函数，并将其纳入基于Softmax的行为策略中。

Result: S2Q在多项挑战性MARL基准测试中表现超过其他MARL算法，展现了更好的适应能力和整体表现。

Conclusion: S2Q通过引入多个子值函数显著提高了MARL算法的适应性和整体表现。

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

Motivation: 研究提出一种新颖的训练优化技术，以加速语言模型的收敛。

Method: PBS利用线性预测器在线估计样本难度，仅需四个特征。

Result: PBS在130M参数的变压器模型实验中实现了6-13%的收敛加快。

Conclusion: PBS显著加快了语言模型的收敛速度，通过动态优先考虑高损失样本，验证了频率统计对于样本难度的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: 提出的框架促进了可持续性评级方法的可扩展和可比性评估，并呼吁AI社区采用AI驱动的方法来加强可持续性评级方法。

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SHAP方法在视觉任务中由于特征（如像素）间的强空间和语义依赖性而面临局限性，因此需要新的方法来提高特征归因的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种新的分割方法，以满足$T$-性质，确保层级间的语义对齐，同时结合Owen值来进行特征归因。

Result: 在图像和表格数据集上的实验表明，O-Shap在归因精度、语义一致性和运行效率方面均优于基线SHAP变体，尤其在结构重要的情况下。

Conclusion: 通过新颖的分割策略和Owen值的结合，本文能有效提升特征归因的方法，满足视觉任务的需求。

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

Conclusion: InstructKG有效地提取和构建与课程目标相一致的知识图谱，展示了其在捕捉学习进展方面的能力。

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA 提供了一种更强大且生物学上更为基础的表示，能够在理解基因组字母的同时把握序列的功能逻辑。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的黑箱特性，需要创新的评估框架来超越表面性能指标，因此本研究寻求揭示其内部认知复杂性的层次性结构。

Method: 本研究利用布鲁姆分类法对高维激活向量进行分析，考察不同认知水平（从基本回忆到抽象综合）在模型残差流中的线性可分性，通过线性分类器进行验证。

Result: 线性分类器在所有布鲁姆认知水平上实现了约95%的平均准确率，显示出认知水平在模型表示的线性可访问子空间中被有效编码。

Conclusion: 结果表明，模型能够在前向传播的早期阶段解决提示的认知难度，并且随着层数的增加，表示的可分性逐渐增强。

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架检测LLM预测中的时间知识泄漏，利用声明的验证和再生来提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否能够准确预测未来事件，必须能够对已解决事件进行回测，这要求模型仅依赖指定过去日期的信息进行推理。

Method: 引入了一种依据声明的框架来检测和量化时间知识泄漏，并通过将模型推理分解为原子声明并按照时间可验证性进行分类，使用Shapley值来测量每个声明对预测的贡献。

Result: 提出了Shapley加权决策关键泄漏率（Shapley-DCLR）这一可解释性指标，衡量决策推理中来源于泄漏信息的比例。TimeSPEC通过生成与声明验证和再生相交错的方式，主动态过滤时间污染，使得每个支持声明都可以追溯到截止日期之前的来源。

Conclusion: TimeSPEC在350个实例上进行了实验，显示传统提示基线存在明显泄漏；其减少Shapley-DCLR，同时保持任务性能，表明明确且可解释的声明级验证优于基于提示的时间约束，适用于可靠的回测。

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

*Hui Min Wong,Philip Heesen,Pascal Janetzky,Martin Bendszus,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedClarify enhances medical diagnostics by generating follow-up questions that improve decision-making and reduce errors by ~27 p.p.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLMs struggle with generating informative follow-up questions during diagnosis, which is crucial for effective clinical reasoning.

Method: The study introduces MedClarify, an AI agent that generates follow-up questions based on candidate diagnoses and information gain to aid in diagnostic reasoning.

Result: MedClarify reduces diagnostic errors by approximately 27 percentage points compared to conventional single-shot LLMs, showing its efficacy in iterative reasoning.

Conclusion: MedClarify significantly improves the diagnostic performance of medical LLMs by generating effective follow-up questions, leading to a reduction in diagnostic errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.

Method: 将表示漂移正则化框架视为曲率矩阵近似问题，采用克罗内克因子近似曲率的方法。

Result: 我们的无数据方法通过克罗内克因子近似曲率获得了实用的正则化器，提升了对任务矢量重新缩放的鲁棒性，无需保留调优。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在任务增加和否定中实现了最先进的结果，并在任务数量上具有常数复杂度。

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

Motivation: 由于临床数据集的不完整性以及缺失模态的严重性，预测非小细胞肺癌患者的生存结果变得困难，因此需要一种新的方法来处理这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种多模态对比变分自编码器（MCVAE），结合了不同数据源的不确定性，通过学习门控机制的融合瓶颈来标准化现有模态的贡献。

Result: 在TCGA-LUAD和TCGA-LUSC数据集上的广泛评估表明，MCVAE在预测疾病特异性生存（DSS）方面的有效性，并且其相对于现有模型在严重缺失情况表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的多模态对比变分自编码器（MCVAE）在预测非小细胞肺癌患者的生存结果方面表现出色，并且在严重缺失场景下展现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

Conclusion: 通过实施技术和组织控制以及适龄设计决策，可以支持为儿童开发符合隐私保护和法律要求的AI应用。

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

Conclusion: M7处理器适合短推断周期，M4处理器在较长推断任务中效率更高，而M0+处理器适合简单任务。

Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.

Result: KG-RAG在基准数据集上的实验结果显示，准确率较RAG模型提高了14.3%，较LLM-only模型提高了21.6%。

Conclusion: KG-RAG有效提升了LLMs在电信领域的准确性和可靠性，表现优于传统模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

Motivation: 旨在解决传统CoT评估依赖目标任务准确性的问题，推动更全面的推理质量评估。

Method: 引入Thinker-Executor框架，分别评估了重用性和可验证性，比较了四个Thinker模型与十个Executor模型的表现。

Result: 重用性和可验证性与标准准确性没有相关性，且专业推理模型的CoT不一定比通用LLM（如Llama和Gemma）更具重用性或可验证性。

Conclusion: 当前的准确性评估未能全面反映推理质量，而重用性和可验证性则揭示了推理问题的盲区。

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入ODESteer方法，建立了激活引导的统一理论框架，并通过实验验证了其在LLM对齐任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing graph diffusion models in chemical validity and performance.

Method: Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model combining chemical priors and decoupled atom encoding.

Result: MolHIT outperforms traditional 1D models and previous graph diffusion models, demonstrating superior results on the MOSES dataset and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MolHIT achieves state-of-the-art performance in molecular graph generation with high chemical validity and improved properties compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the need for extensive mathematical expertise and manual tuning in designing numerical solvers for PDEs, and to improve interpretability and computational efficiency over existing methods.

Method: A multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for PDEs using natural language input.

Result: Experiments on 24 PDE problems show that 	exttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy and effectively selects numerical schemes based on PDE structures.

Conclusion: 	exttt{AutoNumerics} demonstrates competitive accuracy in solving PDEs while being more interpretable and accessible than traditional neural network approaches.

Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extracting semantic relations from multilingual and noisy historical texts across different time periods.

Method: The lab evaluates systems on their ability to classify person-place relations through a three-fold profile, considering accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization.

Result: The initiative links relation extraction to historical data processing, aiding applications in knowledge graphs, biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis.

Conclusion: HIPE-2026 enhances the extraction of person-place relationships from multilingual historical texts, supporting various downstream applications.

Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.
