This emerging threat has\nquickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack\nvectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access\nprivate data.

Once\nconfigured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error\noccurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit.

We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them.

We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the\ntask, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision\nProcess, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative\novergeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC\nattributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches\nbetween unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.\nThen, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and\nrefers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based\nvalue function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function\nupdate. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived\nto promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the\nrelative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various\ncooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its\nsuperior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness."}

The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but\nsuffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to\nimproves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:\nunder a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the\ntotal number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one\nanother. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored\nquestion.\n  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze\ntwo aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new\nProjection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate\nminimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the\ndependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,\nnon-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,\nwe prove that using more than one query per iteration is always\nquery-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal.

Although such choice facilitates the\nMetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited\nin diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further\nresults in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance\ngeneration approach, termed as \\textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse\ntraining problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.\nLSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features\ninto a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space\nleads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.\nBy leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with\nminimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a\ndiversified problem set, termed as \\textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the\neffectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe\ntheir generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to\nexisting training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal\ninteresting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization."}

Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous\nHugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the\nsuccess of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major\nchallenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.\nWe introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that\nunifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,\nmaterial distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single\nautoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs\nabout a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below\n4\\% in porous materials and below 10\\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior\nsingle-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts\nwhile preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and\ntemperature to within 5\\%. This advance transforms problems once considered\nintractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework\nfor optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,\ninertial fusion energy, and national security."}

Howie Huang"], "title": "Automated Cyber Defense with Generalizable Graph-based Reinforcement Learning Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for\nautomated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks\nas a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,\nthese models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering\nthem ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In\nthis work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable\nMarkov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.\nThis approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational\ninductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other\nsystem entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as\nedits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we\nwill show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and\nzero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending\nnever-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of\ncomplex, and multi-agent environments."}

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\nits variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to\ntraditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a\nnovel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts\nthe batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes\nis more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often\nconverges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling\nDiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training\nwhile improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient\ndiversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the\nconvergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and\nCiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges\nsignificantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a\nslight trade-off in performance."}

McClelland"], "title": "Latent learning: episodic memory complements parametric learning by enabling flexible reuse of experiences", "comment": null, "summary": "When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms\ncould improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive\nscience to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure\nto exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the\ntask at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this\nperspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling\nto new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive\nscience points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these\nissues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval\nmechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better\nacross many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential\ncomponents for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of\nwithin-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information\nacross retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible\ncontributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning\nsystems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval\nmethods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization."}

Second,\nthere are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative\ntrigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong\nmarginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,\nas such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not\nexist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three\nkey components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,\nstarting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved\nby evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a\ncandidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target\nclass; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,\nand with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we\ndemonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts\nground-truth backdoor trigger phrases."}
