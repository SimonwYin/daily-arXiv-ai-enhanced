Therefore, healthcare\nproviders and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for\npreventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,\nindividualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep\nquality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional\nlayers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent\nlayers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and\na two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first\nadaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the\ntraining set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism\nis employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We\nconducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11\ndays) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model\nconsistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,\nincluding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The\nbest performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day\nprediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.\nFurthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer\nforecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction\nwindow), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We\nalso conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features\ninfluence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework\noffers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep\nforecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices."}

Our approach includes:\n(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as\nindependent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction\nin the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the\nincorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent\ndependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the\ncommitter, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.\nIncorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads\nwith varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher\nthroughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention\nscenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based\nexecution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining\ncompatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers."}

The method achieves\nlower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs\n0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near\nnominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per\ncalibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially\nnonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than\nABC, enabling fast and practical calibration.

Because browsers\nroutinely process scripts, media, and executable code from unknown sources,\nthey form a critical security boundary between users and adversaries. A common\nattack vector is JavaScript, which exposes a large attack surface due to the\nsheer complexity of modern JavaScript engines. To mitigate these threats,\nmodern engines increasingly adopt software-based fault isolation (SFI). A\nprominent example is Google's V8 heap sandbox, which represents the most widely\ndeployed SFI mechanism, protecting billions of users across all Chromium-based\nbrowsers and countless applications built on Node.js and Electron. The heap\nsandbox splits the address space into two parts: one part containing trusted,\nsecurity-sensitive metadata, and a sandboxed heap containing memory accessible\nto untrusted code.

Consequently, an attacker cannot corrupt trusted data even\nwith full control of the sandboxed data, unless there is a bug in how code\nhandles data from the sandboxed heap.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines.

In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.

In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration\ntesting LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the\nMITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the\nLLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries. This suggests that\nincorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments"}
