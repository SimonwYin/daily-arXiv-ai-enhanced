Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm\nto address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and\nresource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced\nthe Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this\npaper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML\narchitectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like\nScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training\ntime efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault\ntolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant\nimprovements in reducing training times and communication overhead through\nstrategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations\nfacilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability\nchallenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial\nattacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT\ndespite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the\nstrengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets\nthe stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the\nmost effective features of existing systems."}

We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from\nanalytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures\nand latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based\ndefinition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research\ncommunity."}

In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when\ncomposed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover\nsensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We\npresent the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and\npossible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration.

While recent generative AI models, such as\nlarge language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks,\ntheir adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable\nbehaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking.\nExisting anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for\nunstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification.\nDifferential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the\ngeneration of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we\naddress these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity\nmetrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific\ncomplexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and\nspecialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical\nstudy benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of\nvarying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality\ndomain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an\nunsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases.\nThird, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for\nsynthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public\ndatasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed\nprivacy guarantees.

In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,\nwe first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal\ndiscovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future\nexogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module\nthat incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of\nforecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous\nvariables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar\ndesign principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical\nexogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal\ninjection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the\nprediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables."}

Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination\nuniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously\npracticing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors\nobserved in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These\nfindings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained\nfoundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill\nacquisition in robotics.

In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem.
