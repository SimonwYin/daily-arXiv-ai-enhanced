This paper presents a novel \"Declarative\nData Pipeline\" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing\nbillions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture\nintroduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning\ncapabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we\nrefer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches.

In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute\nContinuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent\nchanges in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of\nground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,\nleading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this\npaper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless\nworkflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.\nDatabelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the\nfunction state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads\nfunction states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,\nthe data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing\nstate access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,\nDatabelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state\nmanagement for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions\nare fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing\nredundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow\nefficiency.

The method leverages graph neural\nnetworks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical\nsymptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic\ndependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture\nto model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse\nstructural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is\ndesigned to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings\nand temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key\nprogression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the\nframework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph\nconstruction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.\nThe model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The\nexperiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of\nhyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the\nproposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1\nmetrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the\nmodel's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories.

Sorted., a training-free agentic\nsystem that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system\nruns an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of\nqualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates\nwith diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a\nJudge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design\nprioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves\nglobal constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports\nhuman-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in\npublished papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure\nthan two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and\nGemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)\nwithout inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the\napproach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via\nAPIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead.

Our results show that SPOF\nachieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces\nmean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior\nprivacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments."}

In this\npaper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated\nunlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the\nglobal model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we\npropose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor\nand camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated\ntraining process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage\nsamples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state.
