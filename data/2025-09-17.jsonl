To alleviate this, Tile\nSpatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data\ninto smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging\napplications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex\ntopologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency\nrequirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete\nwithin tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,\nwhile prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This\nhighlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks. Yet,\nrealizing such systems is challenging due to the complexity of enabling\npreemption in graphs with large-scale topologies (e.g., modern large language\nmodels may contain tens of thousands of edges). To tackle this, we present\nIsoSched, the first framework enabling preemptive multi-DNN scheduling on TSS\narchitecture. IsoSched first formulates scheduling of complex-topology graphs\nas an integer-linear program (ILP) and subgraph isomorphism problem; second, it\napplies Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) for load balancing in tile pipelines;\nthird, it employs an Ullmann-based algorithm enhanced by Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) to accelerate subgraph matching, and uses compact matrix encoding\n(i.e., Compressed Sparse Row, CSR) to reduce memory usage. IsoSched outperforms\nLTS-PRM approaches (i.e., PREMA, Planaria, CD-MSA, MoCA) in Latency-Bound\nThroughput (LBT), speedup, and energy efficiency, and achieves higher critical\ntask satisfaction than TSS-NPRM (i.e., HASP) across varying task complexities."}

Due to privacy concerns and\nregulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be\ncentrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training\nmethods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training\nlocal models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.\nHowever, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will\nhinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged\ntraining times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of\nscheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key\nbottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round.

Traditional optimization methods\nas well as reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely exploited to\nsolve these problems under different network scenarios. However, solving such\nproblems becomes more challenging when dealing with a large network scale,\nmulti-dimensional radio resources, and diversified service requirements. To\nthis end, in this paper, a unified framework that combines RL and optimization\ntheory is proposed to solve 0-1 mixed optimization problems in wireless\nnetworks. First, RL is used to capture the process of solving binary variables\nas a sequential decision-making task. During the decision-making steps, the\nbinary (0-1) variables are relaxed and, then, a relaxed problem is solved to\nobtain a relaxed solution, which serves as prior information to guide RL\nsearching policy. Then, at the end of decision-making process, the search\npolicy is updated via suboptimal objective value based on decisions made. The\nperformance bound and convergence guarantees of the proposed framework are then\nproven theoretically. An extension of this approach is provided to solve\nproblems with a non-convex objective function and/or non-convex constraints.\nNumerical results show that the proposed approach reduces the convergence time\nby about 30% over B&B in small-scale problems with slightly higher objective\nvalues.

Such deformation\noften originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence\nvary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods\nfor modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are\ncomputationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.\nNeural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently\nsolving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in\naccelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct\napplication across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical\nlimitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on\ndiffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural\noperator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are\nexplicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural\nnetwork constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is\nthen trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of\ndeformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the\ndiffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient\nprediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The\nproposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient\nsolution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying\ngeometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and\nmulti-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency\nacross parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and\nfeatures."}

To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of\nscheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key\nbottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose\na discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically\nallocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance\ngains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange\nstrategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the\nacceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher\nnumbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach."}

On\nmore complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases\ncompetitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such\nas VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully\nlocal scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.\nFinally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such\nas keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way\nfor efficient learning at the edge."}

Various means to boost ML's adversarial\nrobustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair\nrobustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than\nfrom others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has\nfocused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover\nin this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be\nclassified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry."}

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities.

The primary objective of this research\nstudy was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental\nscale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are\ncontinuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)\nand artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to\ncontrol the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide\ninsights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we\ndeveloped an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,\nInceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured\nperiodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI\nframework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.\nPreliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse\nenvironment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,\nand volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the\ncontrolled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.\nFurthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19\nalgorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy\nleaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms."}

However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred\nworkflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,\nopen-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the\nend-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in\nan early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for\nperspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system\nintegrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise\nexperimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text\ngeneration, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure\naccuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS\ndouble-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable\nhuman review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors\nthe entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.\nThe results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and\nthematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for\nmaintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical\ncompliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including\nhallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and\nincomplete integration of multimodal content."}

In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to\nforecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using\nhistorical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research\nemploys a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support\nVector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly\nweight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of\nmodels, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather\ndata (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better\nthan the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,\nRMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were\nincluded. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF\nmodel outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings\ndemonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight\ngain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic\nfactors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an\ninnovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB\nCWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist\nin preparing datasets for current and future analytical research.."}

While StarCraft II-related environments have driven\nsignificant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on\nmicromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic\nintelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL\nbenchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical\nstratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a\nspecific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic\nelements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,\nthereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making\ncapabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond\nconventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,\nto assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We\nintegrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our\nbenchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that\nHLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic\ndecision-making."}

We test\nAKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy\nacross novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are\nrepresented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in\ntransition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by\nmedium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered\npatterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in\nposition, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural\nconstraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different\nshapes across domains."}
