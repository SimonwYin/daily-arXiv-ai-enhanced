Recent innovations in this\nfield resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution\n(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,\nestablishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD\nnetworks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the\npoint-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current\nstate of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward\nfeasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,\ntrusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding\nof the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD\nlink to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has\nbeen extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still\nlacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that\nsolves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path\ndiscovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in\neach node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller\n(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs\nwithin the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.\nAdditionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,\nthe QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the\nend-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also\nprovides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels\nof the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties."}

Although prior studies have explored the causes and\ndetection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.\n  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data\nas a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a\nconfidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions\nduring training.

We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in\ntheir attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single\nedit.

We demonstrate that character-level\nperturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the\nmost restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based\non the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.\nUnder a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark\ndetector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance.

We\nclose this gap by introducing the first real-world, agent-oriented pentesting\nbenchmark, TermiBench, which shifts the goal from 'flag finding' to achieving\nfull system control. The benchmark spans 510 hosts across 25 services and 30\nCVEs, with realistic environments that require autonomous reconnaissance,\ndiscrimination between benign and exploitable services, and robust exploit\nexecution.

Automating peering partner selection\ncan enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of\npublicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that\ncan predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public\ndatabases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we\nevaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting\npeering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.\nAmong these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and\nefficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly\navailable data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in\npredicting peering partners.

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn.

Given the QA history, there are two\ncategories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:\n(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer\nthe QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based\non the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain\nknowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction.

Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from\ndifferent environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial\ncommunities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological\nconditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating\nboth spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed\npublicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time\npoints, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations\nusing our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework.

To overcome the limitations of\nconventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not\nentirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network\ninference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing\nrelevant information across environments during training.

This shift\nto a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training\nin synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model\nperformance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the\nmodels ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and\ndetection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.\n  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data\nas a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a\nconfidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions\nduring training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross\nEntropy (TCE).
