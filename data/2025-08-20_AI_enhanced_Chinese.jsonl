One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is\nidiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be\nunderstood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.\nIn this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect\nidiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We\nevaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1\ndistillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four\nidiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller\nand more varied than expected.

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands.

This allows ground\ncontroller to generate and distribute collision-free hash seeds to satellites\nin advance. On the satellite, we introduce a port aggregation data structure\nthat decouples the unique flow identifier from its multi-port counter and\nupdates it through efficient bit operations, solving the memory inflation\ncaused by PBLB. Simulation results show that the memory usage of CountingStars\nis reduced by 70\\% on average, and the relative error of measurement is reduced\nby 90\\% on average.

We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association\nnorms, which encode implicit cultural schemas.

SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by\n16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,\nand attains human-level valence and arousal.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)\nreward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the\namount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated\nvia Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)\nSIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)\nSIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a\nnovel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to\ninformative questions for targeted optimization.

Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier\nwith text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The\nDialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from\n47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also\nimproves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong\ngeneric instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,\nQwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and\nfidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently\nexhibit.

ITS\narchitectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is\nprevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions\noften employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust\nsystem defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches\nrely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis\nfor newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's\nresponsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager\nintroduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine\nlearning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts\nand assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a\nsystem, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to\nestimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive\ndefense capabilities.\n  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a\nlimitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This\nextended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse\nthreat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time\nexploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence\nbase, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with\nHAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to\naddress emerging threats.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC.

Existing\nwork has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related\nperformance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee\ntrust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability\ndiagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its\nmultiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:\nnatural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal\nlow interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration\nsimilarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between\nmodels.

We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional\nSTDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,\nwe evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to\ntheir STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can\nreduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects\nused for training.

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show\nhow our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,\nusing queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable\nacross diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials\ndiscovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIVE\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u56fe\u5f62\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u56f0\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DIVE\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "DIVE\u5728\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534710-15%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534730%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e4,000\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u768430,000\u6761\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVE\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales.

Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text\nto a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.\nThe findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child\nlanguage through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into\ntheir use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important\nquestions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed\neducational tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3001\u8bcd\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5fb7\u56fd\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u6545\u4e8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u957f\u4f46\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u9891\u8bcd\uff0c\u540d\u8bcd\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f4e\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u672a\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002"}}

After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we\nexplore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle\nDMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated\nheuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for\nspeeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of\nour heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)\npost-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)\nFinite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier\nseparation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing\nmethods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under\nuniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR\nfilter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the\ncommercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi.

In this work, we identify a significant gap\nbetween LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they\noften answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\",\nthey will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or\neven directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates).

Accepted to RANLP 2025", "summary": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical\nadoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains.

However, existing directed graph neural networks often\nstruggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural\npatterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering\nmechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel\nframework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware\ngraph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value\nembeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical\nspectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables\nlearnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral\nkernels.

Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model.

However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

By integrating well-established\nuncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo\nDropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we\ndemonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its\napplication on both synthetic and simulation datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u201d\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u89c2\u5c55\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u692d\u5706\u7ba1\uff08uncertainty tube\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Deep Ensembles\u3001Monte Carlo Dropout\uff08MC Dropout\uff09\u548cStochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian\uff08SWAG\uff09\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u5728\u76f4\u89c2\u4f20\u8fbe\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u692d\u5706\u7ba1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u77ed\u7f3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for\nneurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and\ncomputational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and\nemulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key\ncomponents. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic\nmodels and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural\nextension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of\nlogic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the\narchitecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated\nat the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as\ncomputational graphs.

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is\nchallenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To\naddress this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and\ninter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship\nbetween anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called\nAdaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or\nfar from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further\naway from the anchor point in the feature space.

In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one.

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose\na general data-dependent learning rate, termed \\textit{heavy-tailed noise aware\nstability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW\nregret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions\nare satisfied.

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and\nNon-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions.

In these cases, preference feedback or expert\ndemonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both\ntogether are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.\nWe develop a new framing for learning from human data, \\emph{reward-rational\npartial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.\nBased on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated\nObjectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a\nbroad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn\nreward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited\namount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD\noutperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use\nLEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a\nsingle one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEOPARD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6307\u5b9a\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7406\u6027\u504f\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LEOPARD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "LEOPARD\u5728\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "LEOPARD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}
