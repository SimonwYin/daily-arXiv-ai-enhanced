This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including\ngeneral and biosecurity forbidden prompts.

This critical\noversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models\nconsequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We\nintroduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation\nframework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to\nsystematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code\nsnippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:\nFirst, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract\nviolations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic\nanalysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis\ndemonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases\nsignificantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using\ncontract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously\nquantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By\nrevealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides\nthe rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of\nLLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our\ncode and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT."}

We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent\nactivity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback\nAbuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion\nabuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate\ntransactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often\nintertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional\ninformation from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion\nabuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation\nfused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information\nof transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the\nresults demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision,\ndetecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times\nmore financial losses in production environments."}

To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation\n(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with\nLLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,\nincorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic\ntopic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable\nperspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,\nvarying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to\nassess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show\nthat multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively\ncorrelated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit\nthem, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource\ncompetition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically\nsimulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,\nand capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and\nsystem stability."}

To bridge this gap, we present\n\\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates\nprior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL).

To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including\nlong horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key\ndesigns: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and\nturn-level policy optimization.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,\nwe develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these\nhyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM\nnot only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM\nframework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle\nhigh-frequency problems.

The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a\nspecific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of\nreinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.\nHowever, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the\napplicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive\nmodeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of\nthe price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --\na sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based\nalgorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide\nregret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency\nof our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based\nmethods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,\nwhile requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This\nhighlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic\npricing in complex, uncertain environments."}

This\nignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires\ninductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or\nrandom walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such\ntask-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects\nthat hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly\nincorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for\ndomain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which\nnaturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any\ngraph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance\nacross language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7\npoints, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph\nBenchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's\nefficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a\nlinear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical\nrelaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific\nheuristics.

We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective\noptimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima\noften emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data\naugmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better\ngeneralisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency.

Our study shows that\ncross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by\nexisting research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of\nfederated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future\nresearch directions that can help overcome these challenges."}

This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis\nof a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving\nreward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the\nreward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy\noptimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive\nnon-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that\nan $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate\nfor static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This\nrate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with\nbounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a\ntheoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques.

Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated\n$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\\Upsilon(k) =\n\\lambda_{k+1} / \\rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace\nused for clustering.

Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated\nrollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a\nfoundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,\ncomplex environments."}

However, a finer-grained pay-to-unlock scheme for premium\nfeatures (e.g., math, coding) is thought to be more economically viable for the\nproviders. Such a scheme requires a feature-locking technique (FLoTE) which is\n(i) effective in refusing locked features, (ii) utility-preserving for unlocked\nfeatures, (iii) robust against evasion or unauthorized credential sharing, and\n(iv) scalable to multiple features and users. However, existing FLoTEs (e.g.,\npassword-locked models) are not robust or scalable. We present Locket, the\nfirst robust and scalable FLoTE to enable pay-to-unlock schemes. Locket uses a\nnovel merging approach to attach adapters to an LLM for refusing unauthorized\nfeatures. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Locket is effective ($100$%\nrefusal on locked features), utility-preserving ($\\leq 7$% utility degradation\nin unlocked features), robust ($\\leq 5$% attack success rate), and scales to\nmultiple features and clients."}

Current LLM alignment methods,\nhowever, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to\nreliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with\nthree key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a\ntarget-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a\nlightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final\nattribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM\noutputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden\nrepresentations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute\nintensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over\nattribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments\non LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text\ngeneration to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,\nwe demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:\npreference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and\ndistillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic\ndifferentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,\nwhich was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning\nand knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts\nto tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack\nscalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a\nlanguage that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a\nfundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,\nbased on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are\nessentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how\nto elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in\ntensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and\ngraphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,\nsuch as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and\nlearnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of\nsymbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI."}

However, such approaches remain\nvulnerable against adversarial examples, i.e., examples that are subtly\nmanipulated to fool a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions.\nThis research presents DeepTrust, a novel metaheuristic that arranges flexible\nclassifiers, like deep neural networks, into an ordered sequence where the\nfinal decision is made by a single internal model based on conditions activated\nin cascade. In the Robust Android Malware Detection competition at the 2025\nIEEE Conference SaTML, DeepTrust secured the first place and achieved\nstate-of-the-art results, outperforming the next-best competitor by up to 266%\nunder feature-space evasion attacks. This is accomplished while maintaining the\nhighest detection rate on non-adversarial malware and a false positive rate\nbelow 1%. The method's efficacy stems from maximizing the divergence of the\nlearned representations among the internal models. By using classifiers\ninducing fundamentally dissimilar embeddings of the data, the decision space\nbecomes unpredictable for an attacker. This frustrates the iterative\nperturbation process inherent to evasion attacks, enhancing system robustness\nwithout compromising accuracy on clean examples."}
